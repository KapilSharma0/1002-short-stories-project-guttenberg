Again, further from the river, there is a garden full\\n\\nof willows, and arbours, and flower-beds not well kept, but very profuse\\n\\nin flowers and luxuriant creepers, knotting and looping the arbours\\n\\ntogether. In each of these arbours is a stationary table of white\\n\\npainted wood, and light moveable chairs of the same colour and material.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went to drink coffee there with some friends in 184--. The stately old\\n\\nmiller came out to greet us, as some of the party were known to him of\\n\\nold. He was of a grand build of a man, and his loud musical voice, with\\n\\nits tone friendly and familiar, his rolling laugh of welcome, went well\\n\\nwith the keen bright eye, the fine cloth of his coat, and the general\\n\\nlook of substance about the place. Poultry of all kinds abounded in the\\n\\nmill-yard, where there were ample means of livelihood for them strewed\\n\\non the ground; but not content with this, the miller took out handfuls\\n\\nof corn from the sacks, and threw liberally to the cocks and hens that\\n\\nran almost under his feet in their eagerness. And all the time he was\\n\\ndoing this, as it were habitually, he was talking to us, and ever and\\n\\nanon calling to his daughter and the serving-maids, to bid them hasten\\n\\nthe coffee we had ordered. He followed us to an arbour, and saw us\\n\\nserved to his satisfaction with the best of everything we could ask for;\\n\\nand then left us to go round to the different arbours and see that each\\n\\nparty was properly attended to; and, as he went, this great, prosperous,\\n\\nhappy-looking man whistled softly one of the most plaintive airs I ever\\n\\nheard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"His family have held this mill ever since the old Palatinate days; or\\n\\nrather, I should say, have possessed the ground ever since then, for two\\n\\nsuccessive mills of theirs have been burnt down by the French. If you\\n\\nwant to see Scherer in a passion, just talk to him of the possibility of\\n\\na French invasion.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at this moment, still whistling that mournful air, we saw the miller\\n\\ngoing down the steps that led from the somewhat raised garden into the\\n\\nmill-yard; and so I seemed to have lost my chance of putting him in a\\n\\npassion.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had nearly finished our coffee, and our \"kucken,\" and our cinnamon\\n\\ncake, when heavy splashes fell on our thick leafy covering; quicker and\\n\\nquicker they came, coming through the tender leaves as if they were\\n\\ntearing them asunder; all the people in the garden were hurrying under\\n\\nshelter, or seeking for their carriages standing outside. Up the steps\\n\\nthe miller came hastening, with a crimson umbrella, fit to cover every\\n\\none left in the garden, and followed by his daughter, and one or two\\n\\nmaidens, each bearing an umbrella.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come into the house--come in, I say. It is a summer-storm, and will\\n\\nflood the place for an hour or two, till the river carries it away.\\n\\nHere, here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we followed him back into his own house. We went into the kitchen\\n\\nfirst. Such an array of bright copper and tin vessels I never saw; and\\n\\nall the wooden things were as thoroughly scoured. The red tile floor was\\n\\nspotless when we went in, but in two minutes it was all over slop and\\n\\ndirt with the tread of many feet; for the kitchen was filled, and still\\n\\nthe worthy miller kept bringing in more people under his great crimson\\n\\numbrella. He even called the dogs in, and made them lie down under the\\n\\ntables.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis daughter said something to him in German, and he shook his head\\n\\nmerrily at her. Everybody laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What did she say?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She told him to bring the ducks in next; but indeed if more people\\n\\ncome we shall be suffocated. What with the thundery weather, and the\\n\\nstove, and all these steaming clothes, I really think we must ask leave\\n\\nto pass on. Perhaps we might go in and see Frau Scherer.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy friend asked the daughter of the house for permission to go into an\\n\\ninner chamber and see her mother. It was granted, and we went into a\\n\\nsort of saloon, overlooking the Neckar; very small, very bright, and\\n\\nvery close. The floor was slippery with polish; long narrow pieces\\n\\nof looking-glass against the walls reflected the perpetual motion of\\n\\nthe river opposite; a white porcelain stove, with some old-fashioned\\n\\nornaments of brass about it; a sofa, covered with Utrecht velvet, a\\n\\ntable before it, and a piece of worsted-worked carpet under it; a vase\\n\\nof artificial flowers; and, lastly, an alcove with a bed in it, on which\\n\\nlay the paralysed wife of the good miller, knitting busily, formed the\\n\\nfurniture. I spoke as if this was all that was to be seen in the room;\\n\\nbut, sitting quietly, while my friend kept up a brisk conversation in a\\n\\nlanguage which I but half understood, my eye was caught by a picture in\\n\\na dark corner of the room, and I got up to examine it more nearly.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was that of a young girl of extreme beauty; evidently of middle rank.\\n\\nThere was a sensitive refinement in her face, as if she almost shrank\\n\\nfrom the gaze which, of necessity, the painter must have fixed upon her.\\n\\nIt was not over-well painted, but I felt that it must have been a good\\n\\nlikeness, from this strong impress of peculiar character which I have\\n\\ntried to describe. From the dress, I should guess it to have been\\n\\npainted in the latter half of the last century. And I afterwards heard\\n\\nthat I was right.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a little pause in the conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you ask Frau Scherer who this is?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMy friend repeated my question, and received a long reply in German.\\n\\nThen she turned round and translated it to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is the likeness of a great-aunt of her husband\\'s.\" (My friend was\\n\\nstanding by me, and looking at the picture with sympathetic curiosity.)\\n\\n\"See! here is the name on the open page of this Bible, \\'Anna Scherer,\\n\\n1778.\\' Frau Scherer says there is a tradition in the family that this\\n\\npretty girl, with her complexion of lilies and roses, lost her colour\\n\\nso entirely through fright, that she was known by the name of the\\n\\nGrey Woman. She speaks as if this Anna Scherer lived in some state\\n\\nof life-long terror. But she does not know details; refers me to her\\n\\nhusband for them. She thinks he has some papers which were written by\\n\\nthe original of that picture for her daughter, who died in this very\\n\\nhouse not long after our friend there was married. We can ask Herr\\n\\nScherer for the whole story if you like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh yes, pray do!\" said I. And, as our host came in at this moment to\\n\\nask how we were faring, and to tell us that he had sent to Heidelberg\\n\\nfor carriages to convey us home, seeing no chance of the heavy rain\\n\\nabating, my friend, after thanking him, passed on to my request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said he, his face changing, \"the aunt Anna had a sad history.\\n\\nIt was all owing to one of those hellish Frenchmen; and her daughter\\n\\nsuffered for it--the cousin Ursula, as we all called her when I was a\\n\\nchild. To be sure, the good cousin Ursula was his child as well. The\\n\\nsins of the fathers are visited on their children. The lady would\\n\\nlike to know all about it, would she? Well, there are papers--a kind\\n\\nof apology the aunt Anna wrote for putting an end to her daughter\\'s\\n\\nengagement--or rather facts which she revealed, that prevented cousin\\n\\nUrsula from marrying the man she loved; and so she would never have\\n\\nany other good fellow, else I have heard say my father would have been\\n\\nthankful to have made her his wife.\" All this time he was rummaging in\\n\\nthe drawer of an old-fashioned bureau, and now he turned round, with a\\n\\nbundle of yellow MSS. in his hand, which he gave to my friend, saying,\\n\\n\"Take it home, take it home, and if you care to make out our crabbed\\n\\nGerman writing, you may keep it as long as you like, and read it at your\\n\\nleisure. Only I must have it back again when you have done with it,\\n\\nthat\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so we became possessed of the manuscript of the following letter,\\n\\nwhich it was our employment, during many a long evening that ensuing\\n\\nwinter, to translate, and in some parts to abbreviate. The letter began\\n\\nwith some reference to the pain which she had already inflicted upon her\\n\\ndaughter by some unexplained opposition to a project of marriage; but I\\n\\ndoubt if, without the clue with which the good miller had furnished us,\\n\\nwe could have made out even this much from the passionate, broken\\n\\nsentences that made us fancy that some scene between the mother and\\n\\ndaughter--and possibly a third person--had occurred just before the\\n\\nmother had begun to write.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou dost not love thy child, mother! Thou dost not care if her heart\\n\\nis broken!\" Ah, God! and these words of my heart-beloved Ursula ring in\\n\\nmy ears as if the sound of them would fill them when I lie a-dying. And\\n\\nher poor tear-stained face comes between me and everything else. Child!\\n\\nhearts do not break; life is very tough as well as very terrible. But I\\n\\nwill not decide for thee. I will tell thee all; and thou shalt bear the\\n\\nburden of choice. I may be wrong; I have little wit left, and never had\\n\\nmuch, I think; but an instinct serves me in place of judgment, and that\\n\\ninstinct tells me that thou and thy Henri must never be married. Yet I\\n\\nmay be in error. I would fain make my child happy. Lay this paper before\\n\\nthe good priest Schriesheim; if, after reading it, thou hast doubts\\n\\nwhich make thee uncertain. Only I will tell thee all now, on condition\\n\\nthat no spoken word ever passes between us on the subject. It would kill\\n\\nme to be questioned. I should have to see all present again.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy father held, as thou knowest, the mill on the Neckar, where thy\\n\\nnew-found uncle, Scherer, now lives. Thou rememberest the surprise with\\n\\nwhich we were received there last vintage twelvemonth. How thy uncle\\n\\ndisbelieved me when I said that I was his sister Anna, whom he had long\\n\\nbelieved to be dead, and how I had to lead thee underneath the picture,\\n\\npainted of me long ago, and point out, feature by feature, the likeness\\n\\nbetween it and thee; and how, as I spoke, I recalled first to my own\\n\\nmind, and then by speech to his, the details of the time when it was\\n\\npainted; the merry words that passed between us then, a happy boy and\\n\\ngirl; the position of the articles of furniture in the room; our father\\'s\\n\\nhabits; the cherry-tree, now cut down, that shaded the window of my\\n\\nbedroom, through which my brother was wont to squeeze himself, in order\\n\\nto spring on to the topmost bough that would bear his weight; and thence\\n\\nwould pass me back his cap laden with fruit to where I sat on the\\n\\nwindow-sill, too sick with fright for him to care much for eating the\\n\\ncherries.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd at length Fritz gave way, and believed me to be his sister Anna,\\n\\neven as though I were risen from the dead. And thou rememberest how\\n\\nhe fetched in his wife, and told her that I was not dead, but was\\n\\ncome back to the old home once more, changed as I was. And she would\\n\\nscarce believe him, and scanned me with a cold, distrustful eye, till\\n\\nat length--for I knew her of old as Babette Mller--I said that I was\\n\\nwell-to-do, and needed not to seek out friends for what they had to\\n\\ngive. And then she asked--not me, but her husband--why I had kept silent\\n\\nso long, leading all--father, brother, every one that loved me in my own\\n\\ndear home--to esteem me dead. And then thine uncle (thou rememberest?)\\n\\nsaid he cared not to know more than I cared to tell; that I was his\\n\\nAnna, found again, to be a blessing to him in his old age, as I had been\\n\\nin his boyhood. I thanked him in my heart for his trust; for were the\\n\\nneed for telling all less than it seems to me now I could not speak of\\n\\nmy past life. But she, who was my sister-in-law still, held back her\\n\\nwelcome, and, for want of that, I did not go to live in Heidelberg as\\n\\nI had planned beforehand, in order to be near my brother Fritz, but\\n\\ncontented myself with his promise to be a father to my Ursula when I\\n\\nshould die and leave this weary world.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat Babette Mller was, as I may say, the cause of all my life\\'s\\n\\nsuffering. She was a baker\\'s daughter in Heidelberg--a great beauty, as\\n\\npeople said, and, indeed, as I could see for myself. I, too--thou sawest\\n\\nmy picture--was reckoned a beauty, and I believe I was so. Babette Mller\\n\\nlooked upon me as a rival. She liked to be admired, and had no one much\\n\\nto love her. I had several people to love me--thy grandfather, Fritz,\\n\\nthe old servant Ktchen, Karl, the head apprentice at the mill--and I\\n\\nfeared admiration and notice, and the being stared at as the \"Schne\\n\\nMllerin,\" whenever I went to make my purchases in Heidelberg.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose were happy, peaceful days. I had Ktchen to help me in the\\n\\nhousework, and whatever we did pleased my brave old father, who was\\n\\nalways gentle and indulgent towards us women, though he was stern enough\\n\\nwith the apprentices in the mill. Karl, the oldest of these, was his\\n\\nfavourite; and I can see now that my father wished him to marry me, and\\n\\nthat Karl himself was desirous to do so. But Karl was rough-spoken, and\\n\\npassionate--not with me, but with the others--and I shrank from him\\n\\nin a way which, I fear, gave him pain. And then came thy uncle Fritz\\'s\\n\\nmarriage; and Babette was brought to the mill to be its mistress. Not\\n\\nthat I cared much for giving up my post, for, in spite of my father\\'s\\n\\ngreat kindness, I always feared that I did not manage well for so large\\n\\na family (with the men, and a girl under Ktchen, we sat down eleven\\n\\neach night to supper). But when Babette began to find fault with Ktchen,\\n\\nI was unhappy at the blame that fell on faithful servants; and by-and-by\\n\\nI began to see that Babette was egging on Karl to make more open love to\\n\\nme, and, as she once said, to get done with it, and take me off to a\\n\\nhome of my own. My father was growing old, and did not perceive all my\\n\\ndaily discomfort. The more Karl advanced, the more I disliked him. He\\n\\nwas good in the main, but I had no notion of being married, and could\\n\\nnot bear any one who talked to me about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings were in this way when I had an invitation to go to Carlsruhe to\\n\\nvisit a schoolfellow, of whom I had been very fond. Babette was all for\\n\\nmy going; I don\\'t think I wanted to leave home, and yet I had been very\\n\\nfond of Sophie Rupprecht. But I was always shy among strangers. Somehow\\n\\nthe affair was settled for me, but not until both Fritz and my father\\n\\nhad made inquiries as to the character and position of the Rupprechts.\\n\\nThey learned that the father had held some kind of inferior position\\n\\nabout the Grand-duke\\'s court, and was now dead, leaving a widow, a noble\\n\\nlady, and two daughters, the elder of whom was Sophie, my friend. Madame\\n\\nRupprecht was not rich, but more than respectable--genteel. When this\\n\\nwas ascertained, my father made no opposition to my going; Babette\\n\\nforwarded it by all the means in her power, and even my dear Fritz had\\n\\nhis word to say in its favour. Only Ktchen was against it--Ktchen\\n\\nand Karl. The opposition of Karl did more to send me to Carlsruhe than\\n\\nanything. For I could have objected to go; but when he took upon himself\\n\\nto ask what was the good of going a-gadding, visiting strangers of whom\\n\\nno one knew anything, I yielded to circumstances--to the pulling of\\n\\nSophie and the pushing of Babette. I was silently vexed, I remember, at\\n\\nBabette\\'s inspection of my clothes; at the way in which she settled that\\n\\nthis gown was too old-fashioned, or that too common, to go with me on\\n\\nmy visit to a noble lady; and at the way in which she took upon herself\\n\\nto spend the money my father had given me to buy what was requisite for\\n\\nthe occasion. And yet I blamed myself, for every one else thought her so\\n\\nkind for doing all this; and she herself meant kindly, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last I quitted the mill by the Neckar-side. It was a long day\\'s\\n\\njourney, and Fritz went with me to Carlsruhe. The Rupprechts lived on\\n\\nthe third floor of a house a little behind one of the principal streets,\\n\\nin a cramped-up court, to which we gained admittance through a doorway\\n\\nin the street. I remember how pinched their rooms looked after the large\\n\\nspace we had at the mill, and yet they had an air of grandeur about them\\n\\nwhich was new to me, and which gave me pleasure, faded as some of it\\n\\nwas. Madame Rupprecht was too formal a lady for me; I was never at my\\n\\nease with her; but Sophie was all that I had recollected her at school:\\n\\nkind, affectionate, and only rather too ready with her expressions\\n\\nof admiration and regard. The little sister kept out of our way; and\\n\\nthat was all we needed, in the first enthusiastic renewal of our early\\n\\nfriendship. The one great object of Madame Rupprecht\\'s life was to\\n\\nretain her position in society; and as her means were much diminished\\n\\nsince her husband\\'s death, there was not much comfort, though there was\\n\\na great deal of show, in their way of living; just the opposite of what\\n\\nit was at my father\\'s house. I believe that my coming was not too much\\n\\ndesired by Madame Rupprecht, as I brought with me another mouth to be\\n\\nfed; but Sophie had spent a year or more in entreating for permission to\\n\\ninvite me, and her mother, having once consented, was too well bred not\\n\\nto give me a stately welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe life in Carlsruhe was very different from what it was at home. The\\n\\nhours were later, the coffee was weaker in the morning, the pottage was\\n\\nweaker, the boiled beef less relieved by other diet, the dresses finer,\\n\\nthe evening engagements constant. I did not find these visits pleasant.\\n\\nWe might not knit, which would have relieved the tedium a little; but we\\n\\nsat in a circle, talking together, only interrupted occasionally by a\\n\\ngentleman, who, breaking out of the knot of men who stood near the door,\\n\\ntalking eagerly together, stole across the room on tiptoe, his hat under\\n\\nhis arm, and, bringing his feet together in the position we called the\\n\\nfirst at the dancing-school, made a low bow to the lady he was going to\\n\\naddress. The first time I saw these manners I could not help smiling;\\n\\nbut Madame Rupprecht saw me, and spoke to me next morning rather severely,\\n\\ntelling me that, of course, in my country breeding I could have seen\\n\\nnothing of court manners, or French fashions, but that that was no\\n\\nreason for my laughing at them. Of course I tried never to smile again\\n\\nin company. This visit to Carlsruhe took place in \\'89, just when every\\n\\none was full of the events taking place at Paris; and yet at Carlsruhe\\n\\nFrench fashions were more talked of than French politics. Madame\\n\\nRupprecht, especially, thought a great deal of all French people. And\\n\\nthis again was quite different to us at home. Fritz could hardly bear\\n\\nthe name of a Frenchman; and it had nearly been an obstacle to my visit\\n\\nto Sophie that her mother preferred being called Madame to her proper\\n\\ntitle of Frau.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration p. 17: Monsieur de la Tourelle.]\\n\\n\\n\\nOne night I was sitting next to Sophie, and longing for the time when we\\n\\nmight have supper and go home, so as to be able to speak together, a\\n\\nthing forbidden by Madame Rupprecht\\'s rules of etiquette, which strictly\\n\\nprohibited any but the most necessary conversation passing between\\n\\nmembers of the same family when in society. I was sitting, I say,\\n\\nscarcely keeping back my inclination to yawn, when two gentlemen came\\n\\nin, one of whom was evidently a stranger to the whole party, from the\\n\\nformal manner in which the host led him up, and presented him to the\\n\\nhostess. I thought I had never seen any one so handsome or so elegant.\\n\\nHis hair was powdered, of course, but one could see from his complexion\\n\\nthat it was fair in its natural state. His features were as delicate as\\n\\na girl\\'s, and set off by two little \"mouches,\" as we called patches in\\n\\nthose days, one at the left corner of his mouth, the other prolonging,\\n\\nas it were, the right eye. His dress was blue and silver. I was so lost\\n\\nin admiration of this beautiful young man, that I was as much surprised\\n\\nas if the angel Gabriel had spoken to me, when the lady of the house\\n\\nbrought him forward to present him to me. She called him Monsieur de la\\n\\nTourelle, and he began to speak to me in French; but though I understood\\n\\nhim perfectly, I dared not trust myself to reply to him in that language.\\n\\nThen he tried German, speaking it with a kind of soft lisp that I\\n\\nthought charming. But, before the end of the evening, I became a little\\n\\ntired of the affected softness and effeminacy of his manners, and the\\n\\nexaggerated compliments he paid me, which had the effect of making all\\n\\nthe company turn round and look at me. Madame Rupprecht was, however,\\n\\npleased with the precise thing that displeased me. She liked either\\n\\nSophie or me to create a sensation; of course she would have preferred\\n\\nthat it should have been her daughter, but her daughter\\'s friend was\\n\\nnext best. As we went away, I heard Madame Rupprecht and Monsieur de la\\n\\nTourelle reciprocating civil speeches with might and main, from which I\\n\\nfound out that the French gentleman was coming to call on us the next\\n\\nday. I do not know whether I was more glad or frightened, for I had been\\n\\nkept upon stilts of good manners all the evening. But still I was\\n\\nflattered when Madame Rupprecht spoke as if she had invited him, because\\n\\nhe had shown pleasure in my society, and even more gratified by Sophie\\'s\\n\\nungrudging delight at the evident interest I had excited in so fine and\\n\\nagreeable a gentleman. Yet, with all this, they had hard work to keep me\\n\\nfrom running out of the salon the next day, when we heard his voice\\n\\ninquiring at the gate on the stairs for Madame Rupprecht. They had made\\n\\nme put on my Sunday gown, and they themselves were dressed as for a\\n\\nreception.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he was gone away, Madame Rupprecht congratulated me on the conquest\\n\\nI had made; for, indeed, he had scarcely spoken to any one else, beyond\\n\\nwhat mere civility required, and had almost invited himself to come in\\n\\nthe evening to bring some new song, which was all the fashion in Paris,\\n\\nhe said. Madame Rupprecht had been out all morning, as she told me, to\\n\\nglean information about Monsieur de la Tourelle. He was a propritaire,\\n\\nhad a small chteau on the Vosges mountains; he owned land there, but\\n\\nhad a large income from some sources quite independent of this property.\\n\\nAltogether, he was a good match, as she emphatically observed. She\\n\\nnever seemed to think that I could refuse him after this account of his\\n\\nwealth, nor do I believe she would have allowed Sophie a choice, even\\n\\nhad he been as old and ugly as he was young and handsome. I do not quite\\n\\nknow--so many events have come to pass since then, and blurred the\\n\\nclearness of my recollections--if I loved him or not. He was very much\\n\\ndevoted to me; he almost frightened me by the excess of his demonstrations\\n\\nof love. And he was very charming to everybody around me, who all spoke\\n\\nof him as the most fascinating of men, and of me as the most fortunate\\n\\nof girls. And yet I never felt quite at my ease with him. I was always\\n\\nrelieved when his visits were over, although I missed his presence when\\n\\nhe did not come. He prolonged his visit to the friend with whom he was\\n\\nstaying at Carlsruhe, on purpose to woo me. He loaded me with presents,\\n\\nwhich I was unwilling to take, only Madame Rupprecht seemed to consider\\n\\nme an affected prude if I refused them. Many of these presents consisted\\n\\nof articles of valuable old jewellery, evidently belonging to his family;\\n\\nby accepting these I doubled the ties which were formed around me by\\n\\ncircumstances even more than by my own consent. In those days we did not\\n\\nwrite letters to absent friends as frequently as is done now, and I had\\n\\nbeen unwilling to name him in the few letters that I wrote home. At\\n\\nlength, however, I learned from Madame Rupprecht that she had written to\\n\\nmy father to announce the splendid conquest I had made, and to request\\n\\nhis presence at my betrothal. I started with astonishment. I had not\\n\\nrealized that affairs had gone so far as this. But when she asked me, in\\n\\na stern, offended manner, what I had meant by my conduct if I did not\\n\\nintend to marry Monsieur de la Tourelle--I had received his visits, his\\n\\npresents, all his various advances without showing any unwillingness or\\n\\nrepugnance--(and it was all true; I had shown no repugnance, though I\\n\\ndid not wish to be married to him,--at least, not so soon)--what could I\\n\\ndo but hang my head, and silently consent to the rapid enunciation of\\n\\nthe only course which now remained for me if I would not be esteemed a\\n\\nheartless coquette all the rest of my days?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was some difficulty, which I afterwards learnt that my\\n\\nsister-in-law had obviated, about my betrothal taking place from home.\\n\\nMy father, and Fritz especially, were for having me return to the mill,\\n\\nand there be betrothed, and from thence be married. But the Rupprechts\\n\\nand Monsieur de la Tourelle were equally urgent on the other side; and\\n\\nBabette was unwilling to have the trouble of the commotion at the mill;\\n\\nand also, I think, a little disliked the idea of the contrast of my\\n\\ngrander marriage with her own.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my father and Fritz came over to the betrothal. They were to stay\\n\\nat an inn in Carlsruhe for a fortnight, at the end of which time the\\n\\nmarriage was to take place. Monsieur de la Tourelle told me he had\\n\\nbusiness at home, which would oblige him to be absent during the\\n\\ninterval between the two events; and I was very glad of it, for I\\n\\ndid not think that he valued my father and my brother as I could have\\n\\nwished him to do. He was very polite to them; put on all the soft, grand\\n\\nmanner, which he had rather dropped with me; and complimented us all\\n\\nround, beginning with my father and Madame Rupprecht, and ending with\\n\\nlittle Alwina. But he a little scoffed at the old-fashioned church\\n\\nceremonies which my father insisted on; and I fancy Fritz must have\\n\\ntaken some of his compliments as satire, for I saw certain signs of\\n\\nmanner by which I knew that my future husband, for all his civil words,\\n\\nhad irritated and annoyed my brother. But all the money arrangements\\n\\nwere liberal in the extreme, and more than satisfied, almost surprised,\\n\\nmy father. Even Fritz lifted up his eyebrows and whistled. I alone did\\n\\nnot care about anything. I was bewitched,--in a dream,--a kind of\\n\\ndespair. I had got into a net through my own timidity and weakness, and\\n\\nI did not see how to get out of it. I clung to my own home-people that\\n\\nfortnight as I had never done before. Their voices, their ways were all\\n\\nso pleasant and familiar to me, after the constraint in which I had\\n\\nbeen living. I might speak and do as I liked without being corrected\\n\\nby Madame Rupprecht, or reproved in a delicate, complimentary way by\\n\\nMonsieur de la Tourelle. One day I said to my father that I did not want\\n\\nto be married, that I would rather go back to the dear old mill; but he\\n\\nseemed to feel this speech of mine as a dereliction of duty as great as\\n\\nif I had committed perjury; as if, after the ceremony of betrothal, no\\n\\none had any right over me but my future husband. And yet he asked me\\n\\nsome solemn questions; but my answers were not such as to do me any\\n\\ngood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dost thou know any fault or crime in this man that should prevent God\\'s\\n\\nblessing from resting on thy marriage with him? Dost thou feel aversion\\n\\nor repugnance to him in any way?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd to all this what could I say? I could only stammer out that I\\n\\ndid not think I loved him enough; and my poor old father saw in this\\n\\nreluctance only the fancy of a silly girl who did not know her own mind,\\n\\nbut who had now gone too far to recede.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo we were married, in the Court chapel, a privilege which Madame\\n\\nRupprecht had used no end of efforts to obtain for us, and which she\\n\\nmust have thought was to secure us all possible happiness, both at the\\n\\ntime and in recollection afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were married; and after two days spent in festivity at Carlsruhe,\\n\\namong all our new fashionable friends there, I bade good-by for ever\\n\\nto my dear old father. I had begged my husband to take me by way of\\n\\nHeidelberg to his old castle in the Vosges; but I found an amount of\\n\\ndetermination, under that effeminate appearance and manner, for which I\\n\\nwas not prepared, and he refused my first request so decidedly that I\\n\\ndared not urge it. \"Henceforth, Anna,\" said he, \"you will move in a\\n\\ndifferent sphere of life; and though it is possible that you may have\\n\\nthe power of showing favour to your relations from time to time, yet\\n\\nmuch or familiar intercourse will be undesirable, and is what I cannot\\n\\nallow.\" I felt almost afraid, after this formal speech, of asking my\\n\\nfather and Fritz to come and see me; but, when the agony of bidding\\n\\nthem farewell overcame all my prudence, I did beg them to pay me a visit\\n\\nere long. But they shook their heads, and spoke of business at home,\\n\\nof different kinds of life, of my being a Frenchwoman now. Only my\\n\\nfather broke out at last with a blessing, and said, \"If my child is\\n\\nunhappy--which God forbid--let her remember that her father\\'s house is\\n\\never open to her.\" I was on the point of crying out, \"Oh! take me back\\n\\nthen now, my father! oh, my father!\" when I felt, rather than saw, my\\n\\nhusband present near me. He looked on with a slightly contemptuous air;\\n\\nand, taking my hand in his, he led me weeping away, saying that short\\n\\nfarewells were always the best when they were inevitable.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt took us two days to reach his chteau in the Vosges, for the roads\\n\\nwere bad and the way difficult to ascertain. Nothing could be more\\n\\ndevoted than he was all the time of the journey. It seemed as if he\\n\\nwere trying in every way to make up for the separation which every hour\\n\\nmade me feel the more complete between my present and my former life.\\n\\nI seemed as if I were only now wakening up to a full sense of what\\n\\nmarriage was, and I dare say I was not a cheerful companion on the\\n\\ntedious journey. At length, jealousy of my regret for my father and\\n\\nbrother got the better of M. de la Tourelle, and he became so much\\n\\ndispleased with me that I thought my heart would break with the sense of\\n\\ndesolation. So it was in no cheerful frame of mind that we approached\\n\\nLes Rochers, and I thought that perhaps it was because I was so unhappy\\n\\nthat the place looked so dreary. On one side, the chteau looked like a\\n\\nraw new building, hastily run up for some immediate purpose, without any\\n\\ngrowth of trees or underwood near it, only the remains of the stone used\\n\\nfor building, not yet cleared away from the immediate neighbourhood,\\n\\nalthough weeds and lichens had been suffered to grow near and over the\\n\\nheaps of rubbish; on the other, were the great rocks from which the\\n\\nplace took its name, and rising close against them, as if almost a\\n\\nnatural formation, was the old castle, whose building dated many\\n\\ncenturies back.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not large nor grand, but it was strong and picturesque, and I used\\n\\nto wish that we lived in it rather than in the smart, half-furnished\\n\\napartment in the new edifice, which had been hastily got ready for my\\n\\nreception. Incongruous as the two parts were, they were joined into a\\n\\nwhole by means of intricate passages and unexpected doors, the exact\\n\\npositions of which I never fully understood. M. de la Tourelle led me to\\n\\na suite of rooms set apart for me, and formally installed me in them, as\\n\\nin a domain of which I was sovereign. He apologised for the hasty\\n\\npreparation which was all he had been able to make for me, but promised,\\n\\nbefore I asked, or even thought of complaining, that they should be made\\n\\nas luxurious as heart could wish before many weeks had elapsed. But\\n\\nwhen, in the gloom of an autumnal evening, I caught my own face and\\n\\nfigure reflected in all the mirrors, which showed only a mysterious\\n\\nbackground in the dim light of the many candles which failed to\\n\\nilluminate the great proportions of the half-furnished salon, I clung to\\n\\nM. de la Tourelle, and begged to be taken to the rooms he had occupied\\n\\nbefore his marriage, he seemed angry with me, although he affected to\\n\\nlaugh, and so decidedly put aside the notion of my having any other\\n\\nrooms but these, that I trembled in silence at the fantastic figures and\\n\\nshapes which my imagination called up as peopling the background of\\n\\nthose gloomy mirrors. There was my boudoir, a little less dreary--my\\n\\nbedroom, with its grand and tarnished furniture, which I commonly made\\n\\ninto my sitting-room, locking up the various doors which led into the\\n\\nboudoir, the salon, the passages--all but one, through which M. de la\\n\\nTourelle always entered from his own apartments in the older part of\\n\\nthe castle. But this preference of mine for occupying my bedroom annoyed\\n\\nM. de la Tourelle, I am sure, though he did not care to express his\\n\\ndispleasure. He would always allure me back into the salon, which I\\n\\ndisliked more and more from its complete separation from the rest of the\\n\\nbuilding by the long passage into which all the doors of my apartment\\n\\nopened. This passage was closed by heavy doors and portires, through\\n\\nwhich I could not hear a sound from the other parts of the house, and,\\n\\nof course, the servants could not hear any movement or cry of mine\\n\\nunless expressly summoned. To a girl brought up as I had been in a\\n\\nhousehold where every individual lived all day in the sight of every\\n\\nother member of the family, never wanted either cheerful words or the\\n\\nsense of silent companionship, this grand isolation of mine was very\\n\\nformidable; and the more so, because M. de la Tourelle, as landed\\n\\nproprietor, sportsman, and what not, was generally out of doors the\\n\\ngreater part of every day, and sometimes for two or three days at a\\n\\ntime. I had no pride to keep me from associating with the domestics; it\\n\\nwould have been natural to me in many ways to have sought them out for\\n\\na word of sympathy in those dreary days when I was left so entirely to\\n\\nmyself, had they been like our kindly German servants. But I disliked\\n\\nthem, one and all; I could not tell why. Some were civil, but there was\\n\\na familiarity in their civility which repelled me; others were rude, and\\n\\ntreated me more as if I were an intruder than their master\\'s chosen\\n\\nwife; and yet of the two sets I liked these last the best.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe principal male servant belonged to this latter class. I was very\\n\\nmuch afraid of him, he had such an air of suspicious surliness about him\\n\\nin all he did for me; and yet M. de la Tourelle spoke of him as most\\n\\nvaluable and faithful. Indeed, it sometimes struck me that Lefebvre\\n\\nruled his master in some things; and this I could not make out. For,\\n\\nwhile M. de la Tourelle behaved towards me as if I were some precious\\n\\ntoy or idol, to be cherished, and fostered, and petted, and indulged, I\\n\\nsoon found out how little I, or, apparently, any one else, could bend\\n\\nthe terrible will of the man who had on first acquaintance appeared\\n\\nto me too effeminate and languid to exert his will in the slightest\\n\\nparticular. I had learnt to know his face better now; and to see that\\n\\nsome vehement depth of feeling, the cause of which I could not fathom,\\n\\nmade his grey eye glitter with pale light, and his lips contract, and\\n\\nhis delicate cheek whiten on certain occasions. But all had been so open\\n\\nand above board at home, that I had no experience to help me to unravel\\n\\nany mysteries among those who lived under the same roof. I understood\\n\\nthat I had made what Madame Rupprecht and her set would have called a\\n\\ngreat marriage, because I lived in a chteau with many servants, bound\\n\\nostensibly to obey me as a mistress. I understood that M. de la Tourelle\\n\\nwas fond enough of me in his way--proud of my beauty, I dare say (for\\n\\nhe often enough spoke about it to me)--but he was also jealous, and\\n\\nsuspicious, and uninfluenced by my wishes, unless they tallied with his\\n\\nown. I felt at this time as if I could have been fond of him too, if he\\n\\nwould have let me; but I was timid from my childhood, and before long my\\n\\ndread of his displeasure (coming down like thunder into the midst of his\\n\\nlove, for such slight causes as a hesitation in reply, a wrong word, or\\n\\na sigh for my father), conquered my humorous inclination to love one who\\n\\nwas so handsome, so accomplished, so indulgent and devoted. But if I\\n\\ncould not please him when indeed I loved him, you may imagine how often\\n\\nI did wrong when I was so much afraid of him as to quietly avoid his\\n\\ncompany for fear of his outbursts of passion. One thing I remember\\n\\nnoticing, that the more M. de la Tourelle was displeased with me, the\\n\\nmore Lefebvre seemed to chuckle; and when I was restored to favour,\\n\\nsometimes on as sudden an impulse as that which occasioned my disgrace,\\n\\nLefebvre would look askance at me with his cold, malicious eyes, and\\n\\nonce or twice at such times he spoke most disrespectfully to M. de la\\n\\nTourelle.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have almost forgotten to say that, in the early days of my life at\\n\\nLes Rochers, M. de la Tourelle, in contemptuous indulgent pity at my\\n\\nweakness in disliking the dreary grandeur of the salon, wrote up to\\n\\nthe milliner in Paris from whom my corbeille de mariage had come, to\\n\\ndesire her to look out for me a maid of middle age, experienced in the\\n\\ntoilette, and with so much refinement that she might on occasion serve\\n\\nas companion to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPORTION II.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Norman woman, Amante by name, was sent to Les Rochers by the Paris\\n\\nmilliner, to become my maid. She was tall and handsome, though upwards\\n\\nof forty, and somewhat gaunt. But, on first seeing her, I liked her;\\n\\nshe was neither rude nor familiar in her manners, and had a pleasant\\n\\nlook of straightforwardness about her that I had missed in all the\\n\\ninhabitants of the chteau, and had foolishly set down in my own mind as\\n\\na national want. Amante was directed by M. de la Tourelle to sit in my\\n\\nboudoir, and to be always within call. He also gave her many instructions\\n\\nas to her duties in matters which, perhaps, strictly belonged to my\\n\\ndepartment of management. But I was young and inexperienced, and thankful\\n\\nto be spared any responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nI daresay it was true what M. de la Tourelle said--before many weeks had\\n\\nelapsed--that, for a great lady, a lady of a castle, I became sadly too\\n\\nfamiliar with my Norman waiting-maid. But you know that by birth we were\\n\\nnot very far apart in rank: Amante was the daughter of a Norman farmer,\\n\\nI of a German miller; and besides that, my life was so lonely! It almost\\n\\nseemed as if I could not please my husband. He had written for some one\\n\\ncapable of being my companion at times, and now he was jealous of my\\n\\nfree regard for her--angry because I could sometimes laugh at her original\\n\\ntunes and amusing proverbs, while when with him I was too much frightened\\n\\nto smile.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom time to time families from a distance of some leagues drove through\\n\\nthe bad roads in their heavy carriages to pay us a visit, and there was\\n\\nan occasional talk of our going to Paris when public affairs should be\\n\\na little more settled. These little events and plans were the only\\n\\nvariations in my life for the first twelve months, if I except the\\n\\nalternations in M. de la Tourelle\\'s temper, his unreasonable anger, and\\n\\nhis passionate fondness.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps one of the reasons that made me take pleasure and comfort in\\n\\nAmante\\'s society was, that whereas I was afraid of everybody (I do not\\n\\nthink I was half as much afraid of things as of persons), Amante feared\\n\\nno one. She would quietly beard Lefebvre, and he respected her all the\\n\\nmore for it; she had a knack of putting questions to M. de la Tourelle,\\n\\nwhich respectfully informed him that she had detected the weak point,\\n\\nbut forebore to press him too closely upon it out of deference to his\\n\\nposition as her master. And with all her shrewdness to others, she\\n\\nhad quite tender ways with me; all the more so at this time because\\n\\nshe knew, what I had not yet ventured to tell M. de la Tourelle, that\\n\\nby-and-by I might become a mother--that wonderful object of mysterious\\n\\ninterest to single women, who no longer hope to enjoy such blessedness\\n\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was once more autumn; late in October. But I was reconciled to my\\n\\nhabitation; the walls of the new part of the building no longer looked\\n\\nbare and desolate; the _dbris_ had been so far cleared away by M. de la\\n\\nTourelle\\'s desire as to make me a little flower-garden, in which I tried\\n\\nto cultivate those plants that I remembered as growing at home. Amante\\n\\nand I had moved the furniture in the rooms, and adjusted it to our\\n\\nliking; my husband had ordered many an article from time to time that he\\n\\nthought would give me pleasure, and I was becoming tame to my apparent\\n\\nimprisonment in a certain part of the great building, the whole of which\\n\\nI had never yet explored. It was October, as I say, once more. The days\\n\\nwere lovely, though short in duration, and M. de la Tourelle had\\n\\noccasion, so he said, to go to that distant estate the superintendence\\n\\nof which so frequently took him away from home. He took Lefebvre with\\n\\nhim, and possibly some more of the lacqueys; he often did. And my\\n\\nspirits rose a little at the thought of his absence; and then the new\\n\\nsensation that he was the father of my unborn babe came over me, and I\\n\\ntried to invest him with this fresh character. I tried to believe that\\n\\nit was his passionate love for me that made him so jealous and\\n\\ntyrannical, imposing, as he did, restrictions on my very intercourse\\n\\nwith my dear father, from whom I was so entirely separated, as far as\\n\\npersonal intercourse was concerned.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had, it is true, let myself go into a sorrowful review of all the\\n\\ntroubles which lay hidden beneath the seeming luxury of my life. I knew\\n\\nthat no one cared for me except my husband and Amante; for it was clear\\n\\nenough to see that I, as his wife, and also as a _parvenue_, was not\\n\\npopular among the few neighbours who surrounded us; and as for the\\n\\nservants, the women were all hard and impudent-looking, treating me\\n\\nwith a semblance of respect that had more of mockery than reality in\\n\\nit; while the men had a lurking kind of fierceness about them, sometimes\\n\\ndisplayed even to M. de la Tourelle, who on his part, it must be confessed,\\n\\nwas often severe even to cruelty in his management of them. My husband\\n\\nloved me, I said to myself, but I said it almost in the form of a\\n\\nquestion. His love was shown fitfully, and more in ways calculated to\\n\\nplease himself than to please me. I felt that for no wish of mine would\\n\\nhe deviate one tittle from any predetermined course of action. I had\\n\\nlearnt the inflexibility of those thin, delicate lips; I knew how anger\\n\\nwould turn his fair complexion to deadly white, and bring the cruel\\n\\nlight into his pale blue eyes. The love I bore to any one seemed to be\\n\\na reason for his hating them, and so I went on pitying myself one long\\n\\ndreary afternoon during that absence of his of which I have spoken, only\\n\\nsometimes remembering to check myself in my murmurings by thinking of\\n\\nthe new unseen link between us, and then crying afresh to think how\\n\\nwicked I was. Oh, how well I remember that long October evening! Amante\\n\\ncame in from time to time, talking away to cheer me--talking about dress\\n\\nand Paris, and I hardly know what, but from time to time looking at me\\n\\nkeenly with her friendly dark eyes, and with serious interest, too,\\n\\nthough all her words were about frivolity. At length she heaped the fire\\n\\nwith wood, drew the heavy silken curtains close; for I had been anxious\\n\\nhitherto to keep them open, so that I might see the pale moon mounting\\n\\nthe skies, as I used to see her--the same moon--rise from behind the\\n\\nKaiser Stuhl at Heidelberg; but the sight made me cry, so Amante shut it\\n\\nout. She dictated to me as a nurse does to a child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, madame must have the little kitten to keep her company,\" she said,\\n\\n\"while I go and ask Marthon for a cup of coffee.\" I remember that speech,\\n\\nand the way it roused me, for I did not like Amante to think I wanted\\n\\namusing by a kitten. It might be my petulance, but this speech--such as\\n\\nshe might have made to a child--annoyed me, and I said that I had reason\\n\\nfor my lowness of spirits--meaning that they were not of so imaginary\\n\\na nature that I could be diverted from them by the gambols of a kitten.\\n\\nSo, though I did not choose to tell her all, I told her a part; and as\\n\\nI spoke, I began to suspect that the good creature knew much of what I\\n\\nwithheld, and that the little speech about the kitten was more thoughtfully\\n\\nkind than it had seemed at first. I said that it was so long since I had\\n\\nheard from my father; that he was an old man, and so many things might\\n\\nhappen--I might never see him again--and I so seldom heard from him or\\n\\nmy brother. It was a more complete and total separation than I had ever\\n\\nanticipated when I married, and something of my home and of my life\\n\\nprevious to my marriage I told the good Amante; for I had not been\\n\\nbrought up as a great lady, and the sympathy of any human being was\\n\\nprecious to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmante listened with interest, and in return told me some of the events\\n\\nand sorrows of her own life. Then, remembering her purpose, she set out\\n\\nin search of the coffee, which ought to have been brought to me an hour\\n\\nbefore; but, in my husband\\'s absence, my wishes were but seldom attended\\n\\nto, and I never dared to give orders.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently she returned, bringing the coffee and a great large cake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"See!\" said she, setting it down. \"Look at my plunder. Madame must eat.\\n\\nThose who eat always laugh. And, besides, I have a little news that will\\n\\nplease madame.\" Then she told me that, lying on a table in the great\\n\\nkitchen, was a bundle of letters, come by the courier from Strasburg\\n\\nthat very afternoon: then, fresh from her conversation with me, she had\\n\\nhastily untied the string that bound them, but had only just traced out\\n\\none that she thought was from Germany, when a servant-man came in, and,\\n\\nwith the start he gave her, she dropped the letters, which he picked\\n\\nup, swearing at her for having untied and disarranged them. She told\\n\\nhim that she believed there was a letter there for her mistress; but he\\n\\nonly swore the more, saying, that if there was it was no business of\\n\\nhers, or of his either, for that he had the strictest orders always to\\n\\ntake all letters that arrived during his master\\'s absence into the\\n\\nprivate sitting-room of the latter--a room into which I had never\\n\\nentered, although it opened out of my husband\\'s dressing-room.\\n\\n\\n\\nI asked Amante if she had not conquered and brought me this letter. No,\\n\\nindeed, she replied, it was almost as much as her life was worth to live\\n\\namong such a set of servants: it was only a month ago that Jacques had\\n\\nstabbed Valentin for some jesting talk. Had I never missed Valentin--that\\n\\nhandsome young lad who carried up the wood into my salon? Poor fellow!\\n\\nhe lies dead and cold now, and they said in the village he had put an\\n\\nend to himself, but those of the household knew better. Oh! I need not\\n\\nbe afraid; Jacques was gone, no one knew where; but with such people it\\n\\nwas not safe to upbraid or insist. Monsieur would be at home the next\\n\\nday, and it would not be long to wait.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I felt as if I could not exist till the next day, without the\\n\\nletter. It might be to say that my father was ill, dying--he might cry\\n\\nfor his daughter from his death-bed! In short, there was no end to the\\n\\nthoughts and fancies that haunted me. It was of no use for Amante to say\\n\\nthat, after all, she might be mistaken--that she did not read writing\\n\\nwell--that she had but a glimpse of the address; I let my coffee cool,\\n\\nmy food all became distasteful, and I wrung my hands with impatience to\\n\\nget at the letter, and have some news of my dear ones at home. All the\\n\\ntime, Amante kept her imperturbable good temper, first reasoning, then\\n\\nscolding. At last she said, as if wearied out, that if I would consent\\n\\nto make a good supper, she would see what could be done as to our going\\n\\nto monsieur\\'s room in search of the letter, after the servants were all\\n\\ngone to bed. We agreed to go together when all was still, and look over\\n\\nthe letters; there could be no harm in that; and yet, somehow, we were\\n\\nsuch cowards we dared not do it openly and in the face of the household.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently my supper came up--partridges, bread, fruits, and cream. How\\n\\nwell I remember that supper! We put the untouched cake away in a sort of\\n\\nbuffet, and poured the cold coffee out of the window, in order that the\\n\\nservants might not take offence at the apparent fancifulness of sending\\n\\ndown for food I could not eat. I was so anxious for all to be in bed,\\n\\nthat I told the footman who served that he need not wait to take away\\n\\nthe plates and dishes, but might go to bed. Long after I thought the\\n\\nhouse was quiet, Amante, in her caution, made me wait. It was past\\n\\neleven before we set out, with cat-like steps and veiled light, along\\n\\nthe passages, to go to my husband\\'s room and steal my own letter, if it\\n\\nwas indeed there; a fact about which Amante had become very uncertain in\\n\\nthe progress of our discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo make you understand my story, I must now try to explain to you the\\n\\nplan of the chteau. It had been at one time a fortified place of some\\n\\nstrength, perched on the summit of a rock, which projected from the side\\n\\nof the mountain. But additions had been made to the old building (which\\n\\nmust have borne a strong resemblance to the castles overhanging the\\n\\nRhine), and these new buildings were placed so as to command a magnificent\\n\\nview, being on the steepest side of the rock, from which the mountain\\n\\nfell away, as it were, leaving the great plain of France in full survey.\\n\\nThe ground-plan was something of the shape of three sides of an oblong;\\n\\nmy apartments in the modern edifice occupied the narrow end, and had\\n\\nthis grand prospect. The front of the castle was old, and ran parallel\\n\\nto the road far below. In this were contained the offices and public\\n\\nrooms of various descriptions, into which I never penetrated. The back\\n\\nwing (considering the new building, in which my apartments were, as the\\n\\ncentre) consisted of many rooms, of a dark and gloomy character, as the\\n\\nmountain-side shut out much of the sun, and heavy pine woods came down\\n\\nwithin a few yards of the windows. Yet on this side--on a projecting\\n\\nplateau of the rock--my husband had formed the flower-garden of which I\\n\\nhave spoken; for he was a great cultivator of flowers in his leisure\\n\\nmoments.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow my bedroom was the corner room of the new buildings on the part\\n\\nnext to the mountain. Hence I could have let myself down into the\\n\\nflower-garden by my hands on the window-sill on one side, without danger\\n\\nof hurting myself; while the windows at right angles with these looked\\n\\nsheer down a descent of a hundred feet at least. Going still farther\\n\\nalong this wing, you came to the old building; in fact, these two\\n\\nfragments of the ancient castle had formerly been attached by some such\\n\\nconnecting apartments as my husband had rebuilt. These rooms belonged to\\n\\nM. de la Tourelle. His bedroom opened into mine, his dressing-room lay\\n\\nbeyond; and that was pretty nearly all I knew, for the servants, as\\n\\nwell as he himself, had a knack of turning me back, under some pretence,\\n\\nif ever they found me walking about alone, as I was inclined to do, when\\n\\nfirst I came, from a sort of curiosity to see the whole of the place of\\n\\nwhich I found myself mistress. M. de la Tourelle never encouraged me to\\n\\ngo out alone, either in a carriage or for a walk, saying always that the\\n\\nroads were unsafe in those disturbed times; indeed, I have sometimes\\n\\nfancied since that the flower-garden, to which the only access from the\\n\\ncastle was through his rooms, was designed in order to give me exercise\\n\\nand employment under his own eye.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to that night. I knew, as I have said, that M. de la\\n\\nTourelle\\'s private room opened out of his dressing-room, and this out\\n\\nof his bedroom, which again opened into mine, the corner-room. But there\\n\\nwere other doors into all these rooms, and these doors led into a long\\n\\ngallery, lighted by windows, looking into the inner court. I do not\\n\\nremember our consulting much about it; we went through my room into\\n\\nmy husband\\'s apartment through the dressing-room, but the door of\\n\\ncommunication into his study was locked, so there was nothing for it\\n\\nbut to turn back and go by the gallery to the other door. I recollect\\n\\nnoticing one or two things in these rooms, then seen by me for the first\\n\\ntime. I remember the sweet perfume that hung in the air, the scent\\n\\nbottles of silver that decked his toilet-table, and the whole apparatus\\n\\nfor bathing and dressing, more luxurious even than those which he had\\n\\nprovided for me. But the room itself was less splendid in its proportions\\n\\nthan mine. In truth, the new buildings ended at the entrance to my\\n\\nhusband\\'s dressing-room. There were deep window recesses in walls eight\\n\\nor nine feet thick, and even the partitions between the chambers were\\n\\nthree feet deep; but over all these doors or windows there fell thick,\\n\\nheavy draperies, so that I should think no one could have heard in one\\n\\nroom what passed in another. We went back into my room, and out into the\\n\\ngallery. We had to shade our candle, from a fear that possessed us, I\\n\\ndon\\'t know why, lest some of the servants in the opposite wing might\\n\\ntrace our progress towards the part of the castle unused by any one\\n\\nexcept my husband. Somehow, I had always the feeling that all the\\n\\ndomestics, except Amante, were spies upon me, and that I was trammelled\\n\\nin a web of observation and unspoken limitation extending over all my\\n\\nactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a light in the upper room; we paused, and Amante would have\\n\\nagain retreated, but I was chafing under the delays. What was the harm\\n\\nof my seeking my father\\'s unopened letter to me in my husband\\'s study?\\n\\nI, generally the coward, now blamed Amante for her unusual timidity.\\n\\nBut the truth was, she had far more reason for suspicion as to the\\n\\nproceedings of that terrible household than I had ever known of. I urged\\n\\nher on, I pressed on myself; we came to the door, locked, but with the\\n\\nkey in it; we turned it, we entered; the letters lay on the table, their\\n\\nwhite oblongs catching the light in an instant, and revealing themselves\\n\\nto my eager eyes, hungering after the words of love from my peaceful,\\n\\ndistant home. But just as I pressed forward to examine the letters, the\\n\\ncandle which Amante held, caught in some draught, went out, and we were\\n\\nin darkness. Amante proposed that we should carry the letters back to\\n\\nmy salon, collecting them as well as we could in the dark, and returning\\n\\nall but the expected one for me; but I begged her to return to my room,\\n\\nwhere I kept tinder and flint, and to strike a fresh light; and so she\\n\\nwent, and I remained alone in the room, of which I could only just\\n\\ndistinguish the size, and the principal articles of furniture: a large\\n\\ntable, with a deep, overhanging cloth, in the middle, escritoires and\\n\\nother heavy articles against the walls; all this I could see as I stood\\n\\nthere, my hand on the table close by the letters, my face towards the\\n\\nwindow, which, both from the darkness of the wood growing high up the\\n\\nmountain-side and the faint light of the declining moon, seemed only\\n\\nlike an oblong of paler purpler black than the shadowy room. How much I\\n\\nremembered from my one instantaneous glance before the candle went out,\\n\\nhow much I saw as my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, I do not\\n\\nknow, but even now, in my dreams, comes up that room of horror, distinct\\n\\nin its profound shadow. Amante could hardly have been gone a minute\\n\\nbefore I felt an additional gloom before the window, and heard soft\\n\\nmovements outside--soft, but resolute, and continued until the end was\\n\\naccomplished, and the window raised.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn mortal terror of people forcing an entrance at such an hour, and in\\n\\nsuch a manner as to leave no doubt of their purpose, I would have turned\\n\\nto fly when first I heard the noise, only that I feared by any quick\\n\\nmotion to catch their attention, as I also ran the danger of doing by\\n\\nopening the door, which was all but closed, and to whose handlings\\n\\nI was unaccustomed. Again, quick as lightning, I bethought me of the\\n\\nhiding-place between the locked door to my husband\\'s dressing-room and\\n\\nthe portire which covered it; but I gave that up, I felt as if I could\\n\\nnot reach it without screaming or fainting. So I sank down softly,\\n\\nand crept under the table, hidden, as I hoped, by the great, deep\\n\\ntable-cover, with its heavy fringe. I had not recovered my swooning\\n\\nsenses fully, and was trying to reassure myself as to my being in a\\n\\nplace of comparative safety, for, above all things, I dreaded the\\n\\nbetrayal of fainting, and struggled hard for such courage as I might\\n\\nattain by deadening myself to the danger I was in by inflicting intense\\n\\npain on myself. You have often asked me the reason of that mark on my\\n\\nhand; it was where, in my agony, I bit out a piece of flesh with my\\n\\nrelentless teeth, thankful for the pain, which helped to numb my terror.\\n\\nI say, I was but just concealed when I heard the window lifted, and one\\n\\nafter another stepped over the sill, and stood by me so close that I\\n\\ncould have touched their feet. Then they laughed and whispered; my brain\\n\\nswam so that I could not tell the meaning of their words, but I heard my\\n\\nhusband\\'s laughter among the rest--low, hissing, scornful--as he kicked\\n\\nsomething heavy that they had dragged in over the floor, and which lay\\n\\nnear me; so near, that my husband\\'s kick, in touching it, touched me\\n\\ntoo. I don\\'t know why--I can\\'t tell how--but some feeling, and not\\n\\ncuriosity, prompted me to put out my hand, ever so softly, ever so\\n\\nlittle, and feel in the darkness for what lay spurned beside me. I\\n\\nstole my groping palm upon the clenched and chilly hand of a corpse!\\n\\n\\n\\nStrange to say, this roused me to instant vividness of thought. Till\\n\\nthis moment I had almost forgotten Amante; now I planned with feverish\\n\\nrapidity how I could give her a warning not to return; or rather, I\\n\\nshould say, I tried to plan, for all my projects were utterly futile, as\\n\\nI might have seen from the first. I could only hope she would hear the\\n\\nvoices of those who were now busy in trying to kindle a light, swearing\\n\\nawful oaths at the mislaid articles which would have enabled them to\\n\\nstrike fire. I heard her step outside coming nearer and nearer; I saw\\n\\nfrom my hiding-place the line of light beneath the door more and more\\n\\ndistinctly; close to it her footstep paused; the men inside--at the time\\n\\nI thought they had been only two, but I found out afterwards there were\\n\\nthree--paused in their endeavours, and were quite still, as breathless\\n\\nas myself, I suppose. Then she slowly pushed the door open with gentle\\n\\nmotion, to save her flickering candle from being again extinguished. For\\n\\na moment all was still. Then I heard my husband say, as he advanced\\n\\ntowards her (he wore riding-boots, the shape of which I knew well, as I\\n\\ncould see them in the light),--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Amante, may I ask what brings you here into my private room?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stood between her and the dead body of a man, from which ghastly heap\\n\\nI shrank away as it almost touched me, so close were we all together. I\\n\\ncould not tell whether she saw it or not; I could give her no warning,\\n\\nnor make any dumb utterance of signs to bid her what to say--if, indeed,\\n\\nI knew myself what would be best for her to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer voice was quite changed when she spoke; quite hoarse, and very low;\\n\\nyet it was steady enough as she said, what was the truth, that she had\\n\\ncome to look for a letter which she believed had arrived for me from\\n\\nGermany. Good, brave Amante! Not a word about me. M. de la Tourelle\\n\\nanswered with a grim blasphemy and a fearful threat. He would have no\\n\\none prying into his premises; madame should have her letters, if there\\n\\nwere any, when he chose to give them to her, if, indeed, he thought\\n\\nit well to give them to her at all. As for Amante, this was her first\\n\\nwarning, but it was also her last; and, taking the candle out of her\\n\\nhand, he turned her out of the room, his companions discreetly making a\\n\\nscreen, so as to throw the corpse into deep shadow. I heard the key turn\\n\\nin the door after her--if I had ever had any thought of escape it was\\n\\ngone now. I only hoped that whatever was to befal me might soon be over,\\n\\nfor the tension of nerve was growing more than I could bear. The instant\\n\\nshe could be supposed to be out of hearing, two voices began speaking\\n\\nin the most angry terms to my husband, upbraiding him for not having\\n\\ndetained her, gagged her--nay, one was for killing her, saying he had\\n\\nseen her eye fall on the face of the dead man, whom he now kicked in his\\n\\npassion. Though the form of their speech was as if they were speaking\\n\\nto equals, yet in their tone there was something of fear. I am sure my\\n\\nhusband was their superior, or captain, or somewhat. He replied to them\\n\\nalmost as if he were scoffing at them, saying it was such an expenditure\\n\\nof labour having to do with fools; that, ten to one, the woman was\\n\\nonly telling the simple truth, and that she was frightened enough by\\n\\ndiscovering her master in his room to be thankful to escape and return\\n\\nto her mistress, to whom he could easily explain on the morrow how he\\n\\nhappened to return in the dead of night. But his companions fell to\\n\\ncursing me, and saying that since M. de la Tourelle had been married he\\n\\nwas fit for nothing but to dress himself fine and scent himself with\\n\\nperfume; that, as for me, they could have got him twenty girls prettier,\\n\\nand with far more spirit in them. He quietly answered that I suited him,\\n\\nand that was enough. All this time they were doing something--I could\\n\\nnot see what--to the corpse; sometimes they were too busy rifling the\\n\\ndead body, I believe, to talk; again they let it fall with a heavy,\\n\\nresistless thud, and took to quarrelling. They taunted my husband with\\n\\nangry vehemence, enraged at his scoffing and scornful replies, his\\n\\nmocking laughter. Yes, holding up his poor dead victim, the better to\\n\\nstrip him of whatever he wore that was valuable, I heard my husband\\n\\nlaugh just as he had done when exchanging repartees in the little salon\\n\\nof the Rupprechts at Carlsruhe. I hated and dreaded him from that moment.\\n\\nAt length, as if to make an end of the subject, he said, with cool\\n\\ndetermination in his voice,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, my good friends, what is the use of all this talking, when you\\n\\nknow in your hearts that, if I suspected my wife of knowing more than I\\n\\nchose of my affairs, she would not outlive the day? Remember Victorine.\\n\\nBecause she merely joked about my affairs in an imprudent manner, and\\n\\nrejected my advice to keep a prudent tongue--to see what she liked, but\\n\\nask nothing and say nothing--she has gone a long journey--longer than to\\n\\nParis.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But this one is different to her; we knew all that Madame Victorine\\n\\nknew, she was such a chatterbox; but this one may find out a vast deal,\\n\\nand never breathe a word about it, she is so sly. Some fine day we may\\n\\nhave the country raised, and the gendarmes down upon us from Strasburg,\\n\\nand all owing to your pretty doll, with her cunning ways of coming over\\n\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI think this roused M. de la Tourelle a little from his contemptuous\\n\\nindifference, for he ground an oath through his teeth, and said, \"Feel!\\n\\nthis dagger is sharp, Henri. If my wife breathes a word, and I am such a\\n\\nfool as not to have stopped her mouth effectually before she can bring\\n\\ndown gendarmes upon us, just let that good steel find its way to my\\n\\nheart. Let her guess but one tittle, let her have but one slight suspicion\\n\\nthat I am not a \\'grand propritaire,\\' much less imagine that I am a\\n\\nchief of Chauffeurs, and she follows Victorine on the long journey\\n\\nbeyond Paris that very day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'ll outwit you yet; or I never judged women well. Those still silent\\n\\nones are the devil. She\\'ll be off during some of your absences, having\\n\\npicked out some secret that will break us all on the wheel.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bah!\" said his voice; and then in a minute he added, \"Let her go if she\\n\\nwill. But, where she goes, I will follow; so don\\'t cry before you\\'re\\n\\nhurt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time, they had nearly stripped the body; and the conversation\\n\\nturned on what they should do with it. I learnt that the dead man was\\n\\nthe Sieur de Poissy, a neighbouring gentleman, whom I had often heard of\\n\\nas hunting with my husband. I had never seen him, but they spoke as if\\n\\nhe had come upon them while they were robbing some Cologne merchant,\\n\\ntorturing him after the cruel practice of the Chauffeurs, by roasting\\n\\nthe feet of their victims in order to compel them to reveal any hidden\\n\\ncircumstances connected with their wealth, of which the Chauffeurs\\n\\nafterwards made use; and this Sieur de Poissy coming down upon them,\\n\\nand recognising M. de la Tourelle, they had killed him, and brought him\\n\\nthither after nightfall. I heard him whom I called my husband, laugh his\\n\\nlittle light laugh as he spoke of the way in which the dead body had\\n\\nbeen strapped before one of the riders, in such a way that it appeared\\n\\nto any passer-by as if, in truth, the murderer were tenderly supporting\\n\\nsome sick person. He repeated some mocking reply of double meaning, which\\n\\nhe himself had given to some one who made inquiry. He enjoyed the play\\n\\nupon words, softly applauding his own wit. And all the time the poor\\n\\nhelpless outstretched arms of the dead lay close to his dainty boot!\\n\\nThen another stooped (my heart stopped beating), and picked up a letter\\n\\nlying on the ground--a letter that had dropped out of M. de Poissy\\'s\\n\\npocket--a letter from his wife, full of tender words of endearment and\\n\\npretty babblings of love. This was read aloud, with coarse ribald\\n\\ncomments on every sentence, each trying to outdo the previous speaker.\\n\\nWhen they came to some pretty words about a sweet Maurice, their little\\n\\nchild away with its mother on some visit, they laughed at M. de la\\n\\nTourelle, and told him that he would be hearing such woman\\'s drivelling\\n\\nsome day. Up to that moment, I think, I had only feared him, but his\\n\\nunnatural, half-ferocious reply made me hate even more than I dreaded\\n\\nhim. But now they grew weary of their savage merriment; the jewels and\\n\\nwatch had been apprised, the money and papers examined; and apparently\\n\\nthere was some necessity for the body being interred quietly and before\\n\\ndaybreak. They had not dared to leave him where he was slain for fear\\n\\nlest people should come and recognise him, and raise the hue and cry\\n\\nupon them. For they all along spoke as if it was their constant endeavour\\n\\nto keep the immediate neighbourhood of Les Rochers in the most orderly\\n\\nand tranquil condition, so as never to give cause for visits from the\\n\\ngendarmes. They disputed a little as to whether they should make their\\n\\nway into the castle larder through the gallery, and satisfy their hunger\\n\\nbefore the hasty interment, or afterwards. I listened with eager feverish\\n\\ninterest as soon as this meaning of their speeches reached my hot and\\n\\ntroubled brain, for at the time the words they uttered seemed only to\\n\\nstamp themselves with terrible force on my memory, so that I could hardly\\n\\nkeep from repeating them aloud like a dull, miserable, unconscious echo;\\n\\nbut my brain was numb to the sense of what they said, unless I myself\\n\\nwere named, and then, I suppose, some instinct of self-preservation\\n\\nstirred within me, and quickened my sense. And how I strained my ears,\\n\\nand nerved my hands and limbs, beginning to twitch with convulsive\\n\\nmovements, which I feared might betray me! I gathered every word they\\n\\nspoke, not knowing which proposal to wish for, but feeling that whatever\\n\\nwas finally decided upon, my only chance of escape was drawing near. I\\n\\nonce feared lest my husband should go to his bedroom before I had had\\n\\nthat one chance, in which case he would most likely have perceived my\\n\\nabsence. He said that his hands were soiled (I shuddered, for it might\\n\\nbe with life-blood), and he would go and cleanse them; but some bitter\\n\\njest turned his purpose, and he left the room with the other two--left\\n\\nit by the gallery door. Left me alone in the dark with the stiffening\\n\\ncorpse!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, now was my time, if ever; and yet I could not move. It was not my\\n\\ncramped and stiffened joints that crippled me, it was the sensation\\n\\nof that dead man\\'s close presence. I almost fancied--I almost fancy\\n\\nstill--I heard the arm nearest to me move; lift itself up, as if once\\n\\nmore imploring, and fall in dead despair. At that fancy--if fancy it\\n\\nwere--I screamed aloud in mad terror, and the sound of my own strange\\n\\nvoice broke the spell. I drew myself to the side of the table farthest\\n\\nfrom the corpse, with as much slow caution as if I really could have\\n\\nfeared the clutch of that poor dead arm, powerless for evermore. I\\n\\nsoftly raised myself up, and stood sick and trembling, holding by the\\n\\ntable, too dizzy to know what to do next. I nearly fainted, when a\\n\\nlow voice spoke--when Amante, from the outside of the door, whispered,\\n\\n\"Madame!\" The faithful creature had been on the watch, had heard my\\n\\nscream, and having seen the three ruffians troop along the gallery down\\n\\nthe stairs, and across the court to the offices in the other wing of the\\n\\ncastle, she had stolen to the door of the room in which I was. The sound\\n\\nof her voice gave me strength; I walked straight towards it, as one\\n\\nbenighted on a dreary moor, suddenly perceiving the small steady light\\n\\nwhich tells of human dwellings, takes heart, and steers straight onward.\\n\\nWhere I was, where that voice was, I knew not; but go to it I must, or\\n\\ndie. The door once opened--I know not by which of us--I fell upon her\\n\\nneck, grasping her tight, till my hands ached with the tension of their\\n\\nhold. Yet she never uttered a word. Only she took me up in her vigorous\\n\\narms, and bore me to my room, and laid me on my bed. I do not know more;\\n\\nas soon as I was placed there I lost sense; I came to myself with a\\n\\nhorrible dread lest my husband was by me, with a belief that he was in\\n\\nthe room, in hiding, waiting to hear my first words, watching for the\\n\\nleast sign of the terrible knowledge I possessed to murder me. I dared\\n\\nnot breathe quicker, I measured and timed each heavy inspiration; I did\\n\\nnot speak, nor move, nor even open my eyes, for long after I was in my\\n\\nfull, my miserable senses. I heard some one treading softly about the\\n\\nroom, as if with a purpose, not as if for curiosity, or merely to\\n\\nbeguile the time; some one passed in and out of the salon; and I still\\n\\nlay quiet, feeling as if death were inevitable, but wishing that the\\n\\nagony of death were past. Again faintness stole over me; but just as I\\n\\nwas sinking into the horrible feeling of nothingness, I heard Amante\\'s\\n\\nvoice close to me, saying,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Drink this, madame, and let us begone. All is ready.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI let her put her arm under my head and raise me, and pour something\\n\\ndown my throat. All the time she kept talking in a quiet, measured\\n\\nvoice, unlike her own, so dry and authoritative; she told me that a suit\\n\\nof her clothes lay ready for me, that she herself was as much disguised\\n\\nas the circumstances permitted her to be, that what provisions I had\\n\\nleft from my supper were stowed away in her pockets, and so she went\\n\\non, dwelling on little details of the most commonplace description,\\n\\nbut never alluding for an instant to the fearful cause why flight was\\n\\nnecessary. I made no inquiry as to how she knew, or what she knew. I\\n\\nnever asked her either then or afterwards, I could not bear it--we kept\\n\\nour dreadful secret close. But I suppose she must have been in the\\n\\ndressing-room adjoining, and heard all.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, I dared not speak even to her, as if there were anything beyond\\n\\nthe most common event in life in our preparing thus to leave the house\\n\\nof blood by stealth in the dead of night. She gave me directions--short\\n\\ncondensed directions, without reasons--just as you do to a child; and\\n\\nlike a child I obeyed her. She went often to the door and listened; and\\n\\noften, too, she went to the window, and looked anxiously out. For me, I\\n\\nsaw nothing but her, and I dared not let my eyes wander from her for a\\n\\nminute; and I heard nothing in the deep midnight silence but her soft\\n\\nmovements, and the heavy beating of my own heart. At last she took my\\n\\nhand, and led me in the dark, through the salon, once more into the\\n\\nterrible gallery, where across the black darkness the windows admitted\\n\\npale sheeted ghosts of light upon the floor. Clinging to her I went;\\n\\nunquestioning--for she was human sympathy to me after the isolation of\\n\\nmy unspeakable terror. On we went, turning to the left instead of to\\n\\nthe right, past my suite of sitting-rooms where the gilding was red\\n\\nwith blood, into that unknown wing of the castle that fronted the main\\n\\nroad lying parallel far below. She guided me along the basement passages\\n\\nto which we had now descended, until we came to a little open door,\\n\\nthrough which the air blew chill and cold, bringing for the first time\\n\\na sensation of life to me. The door led into a kind of cellar, through\\n\\nwhich we groped our way to an opening like a window, but which, instead\\n\\nof being glazed, was only fenced with iron bars, two of which were\\n\\nloose, as Amante evidently knew, for she took them out with the ease of\\n\\none who had performed the action often before, and then helped me to\\n\\nfollow her out into the free, open air.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe stole round the end of the building, and on turning the corner--she\\n\\nfirst--I felt her hold on me tighten for an instant, and the next step\\n\\nI, too, heard distant voices, and the blows of a spade upon the heavy\\n\\nsoil, for the night was very warm and still.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had not spoken a word; we did not speak now. Touch was safer and as\\n\\nexpressive. She turned down towards the high road; I followed. I did not\\n\\nknow the path; we stumbled again and again, and I was much bruised; so\\n\\ndoubtless was she; but bodily pain did me good. At last, we were on the\\n\\nplainer path of the high road.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had such faith in her that I did not venture to speak, even when she\\n\\npaused, as wondering to which hand she should turn. But now, for the\\n\\nfirst time, she spoke:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Which way did you come when he brought you here first?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI pointed, I could not speak.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe turned in the opposite direction; still going along the high road.\\n\\nIn about an hour, we struck up to the mountain-side, scrambling far up\\n\\nbefore we even dared to rest; far up and away again before day had fully\\n\\ndawned. Then we looked about for some place of rest and concealment: and\\n\\nnow we dared to speak in whispers. Amante told me that she had locked\\n\\nthe door of communication between his bedroom and mine, and, as in a\\n\\ndream, I was aware that she had also locked and brought away the key of\\n\\nthe door between the latter and the salon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He will have been too busy this night to think much about you--he will\\n\\nsuppose you are asleep--I shall be the first to be missed; but they will\\n\\nonly just now be discovering our loss.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember those last words of hers made me pray to go on; I felt as if\\n\\nwe were losing precious time in thinking either of rest or concealment;\\n\\nbut she hardly replied to me, so busy was she in seeking out some\\n\\nhiding-place. At length, giving it up in despair, we proceeded onwards a\\n\\nlittle way; the mountain-side sloped downwards rapidly, and in the full\\n\\nmorning light we saw ourselves in a narrow valley, made by a stream\\n\\nwhich forced its way along it. About a mile lower down there rose the\\n\\npale blue smoke of a village, a mill-wheel was lashing up the water\\n\\nclose at hand, though out of sight. Keeping under the cover of every\\n\\nsheltering tree or bush, we worked our way down past the mill, down to a\\n\\none-arched bridge, which doubtless formed part of the road between the\\n\\nvillage and the mill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This will do,\" said she; and we crept under the space, and climbing a\\n\\nlittle way up the rough stone-work, we seated ourselves on a projecting\\n\\nledge, and crouched in the deep damp shadow. Amante sat a little above\\n\\nme, and made me lay my head on her lap. Then she fed me, and took some\\n\\nfood herself; and opening out her great dark cloak, she covered up\\n\\nevery light-coloured speck about us; and thus we sat, shivering and\\n\\nshuddering, yet feeling a kind of rest through it all, simply from the\\n\\nfact that motion was no longer imperative, and that during the daylight\\n\\nour only chance of safety was to be still. But the damp shadow in which\\n\\nwe were sitting was blighting, from the circumstance of the sunlight\\n\\nnever penetrating there; and I dreaded lest, before night and the time\\n\\nfor exertion again came on, I should feel illness creeping all over me.\\n\\nTo add to our discomfort, it had rained the whole day long, and the\\n\\nstream, fed by a thousand little mountain brooklets, began to swell into\\n\\na torrent, rushing over the stones with a perpetual and dizzying noise.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery now and then I was wakened from the painful doze into which I\\n\\ncontinually fell, by a sound of horses\\' feet over our head: sometimes\\n\\nlumbering heavily as if dragging a burden, sometimes rattling and\\n\\ngalloping, and with the sharper cry of men\\'s voices coming cutting\\n\\nthrough the roar of the waters. At length, day fell. We had to drop into\\n\\nthe stream, which came above our knees as we waded to the bank. There we\\n\\nstood, stiff and shivering. Even Amante\\'s courage seemed to fail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must pass this night in shelter, somehow,\" said she. For indeed the\\n\\nrain was coming down pitilessly. I said nothing. I thought that surely\\n\\nthe end must be death in some shape; and I only hoped that to death\\n\\nmight not be added the terror of the cruelty of men. In a minute or so\\n\\nshe had resolved on her course of action. We went up the stream to the\\n\\nmill. The familiar sounds, the scent of the wheat, the flour whitening\\n\\nthe walls--all reminded me of home, and it seemed to me as if I must\\n\\nstruggle out of this nightmare and waken, and find myself once more a\\n\\nhappy girl by the Neckar-side. They were long in unbarring the door at\\n\\nwhich Amante had knocked: at length, an old feeble voice inquired who\\n\\nwas there, and what was sought? Amante answered shelter from the storm\\n\\nfor two women; but the old woman replied, with suspicious hesitation,\\n\\nthat she was sure it was a man who was asking for shelter, and that she\\n\\ncould not let us in. But at length she satisfied herself, and unbarred\\n\\nthe heavy door, and admitted us. She was not an unkindly woman; but her\\n\\nthoughts all travelled in one circle, and that was, that her master,\\n\\nthe miller, had told her on no account to let any man into the place\\n\\nduring his absence, and that she did not know if he would not think two\\n\\nwomen as bad; and yet that as we were not men, no one could say she had\\n\\ndisobeyed him, for it was a shame to let a dog be out such a night as\\n\\nthis. Amante, with ready wit, told her to let no one know that we had\\n\\ntaken shelter there that night, and that then her master could not blame\\n\\nher; and while she was thus enjoining secrecy as the wisest course, with\\n\\na view to far other people than the miller, she was hastily helping me\\n\\nto take off my wet clothes, and spreading them, as well as the brown\\n\\nmantle that had covered us both, before the great stove which warmed the\\n\\nroom with the effectual heat that the old woman\\'s failing vitality\\n\\nrequired. All this time the poor creature was discussing with herself as\\n\\nto whether she had disobeyed orders, in a kind of garrulous way that\\n\\nmade me fear much for her capability of retaining anything secret if she\\n\\nwas questioned. By-and-by, she wandered away to an unnecessary revelation\\n\\nof her master\\'s whereabouts: gone to help in the search for his landlord,\\n\\nthe Sieur de Poissy, who lived at the chteau just above, and who had not\\n\\nreturned from his chase the day before; so the intendant imagined he\\n\\nmight have met with some accident, and had summoned the neighbours to\\n\\nbeat the forest and the hill-side. She told us much besides, giving us\\n\\nto understand that she would fain meet with a place as housekeeper where\\n\\nthere were more servants and less to do, as her life here was very lonely\\n\\nand dull, especially since her master\\'s son had gone away--gone to the\\n\\nwars. She then took her supper, which was evidently apportioned out to\\n\\nher with a sparing hand, as, even if the idea had come into her head,\\n\\nshe had not enough to offer us any. Fortunately, warmth was all that\\n\\nwe required, and that, thanks to Amante\\'s cares, was returning to our\\n\\nchilled bodies. After supper, the old woman grew drowsy; but she seemed\\n\\nuncomfortable at the idea of going to sleep and leaving us still in the\\n\\nhouse. Indeed, she gave us pretty broad hints as to the propriety of our\\n\\ngoing once more out into the bleak and stormy night; but we begged to be\\n\\nallowed to stay under shelter of some kind; and, at last, a bright idea\\n\\ncame over her, and she bade us mount by a ladder to a kind of loft, which\\n\\nwent half over the lofty mill-kitchen in which we were sitting. We\\n\\nobeyed her--what else could we do?--and found ourselves in a spacious\\n\\nfloor, without any safeguard or wall, boarding, or railing, to keep us\\n\\nfrom falling over into the kitchen in case we went too near the edge. It\\n\\nwas, in fact, the store-room or garret for the household. There was\\n\\nbedding piled up, boxes and chests, mill sacks, the winter store of\\n\\napples and nuts, bundles of old clothes, broken furniture, and many\\n\\nother things. No sooner were we up there, than the old woman dragged\\n\\nthe ladder, by which we had ascended, away with a chuckle, as if she was\\n\\nnow secure that we could do no mischief, and sat herself down again once\\n\\nmore, to doze and await her master\\'s return. We pulled out some bedding,\\n\\nand gladly laid ourselves down in our dried clothes and in some warmth,\\n\\nhoping to have the sleep we so much needed to refresh us and prepare us\\n\\nfor the next day. But I could not sleep, and I was aware, from her\\n\\nbreathing, that Amante was equally wakeful. We could both see through\\n\\nthe crevices between the boards that formed the flooring into the\\n\\nkitchen below, very partially lighted by the common lamp that hung\\n\\nagainst the wall near the stove on the opposite side to that on which we\\n\\nwere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPORTION III.\\n\\n\\n\\nFar on in the night there were voices outside reached us in our\\n\\nhiding-place; an angry knocking at the door, and we saw through the\\n\\nchinks the old woman rouse herself up to go and open it for her master,\\n\\nwho came in, evidently half drunk. To my sick horror, he was followed\\n\\nby Lefebvre, apparently as sober and wily as ever. They were talking\\n\\ntogether as they came in, disputing about something; but the miller\\n\\nstopped the conversation to swear at the old woman for having fallen\\n\\nasleep, and, with tipsy anger, and even with blows, drove the poor\\n\\nold creature out of the kitchen to bed. Then he and Lefebvre went on\\n\\ntalking--about the Sieur de Poissy\\'s disappearance. It seemed that\\n\\nLefebvre had been out all day, along with other of my husband\\'s men,\\n\\nostensibly assisting in the search; in all probability trying to blind\\n\\nthe Sieur de Poissy\\'s followers by putting them on a wrong scent, and\\n\\nalso, I fancied, from one or two of Lefebvre\\'s sly questions, combining\\n\\nthe hidden purpose of discovering us.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the miller was tenant and vassal to the Sieur de Poissy, he\\n\\nseemed to me to be much more in league with the people of M. de la\\n\\nTourelle. He was evidently aware, in part, of the life which Lefebvre\\n\\nand the others led; although, again, I do not suppose he knew or\\n\\nimagined one-half of their crimes; and also, I think, he was seriously\\n\\ninterested in discovering the fate of his master, little suspecting\\n\\nLefebvre of murder or violence. He kept talking himself, and letting out\\n\\nall sorts of thoughts and opinions; watched by the keen eyes of Lefebvre\\n\\ngleaming out below his shaggy eyebrows. It was evidently not the cue of\\n\\nthe latter to let out that his master\\'s wife had escaped from that vile\\n\\nand terrible den; but though he never breathed a word relating to us,\\n\\nnot the less was I certain he was thirsting for our blood, and lying in\\n\\nwait for us at every turn of events. Presently he got up and took his\\n\\nleave; and the miller bolted him out, and stumbled off to bed. Then we\\n\\nfell asleep, and slept sound and long.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, when I awoke, I saw Amante, half raised, resting on\\n\\none hand, and eagerly gazing, with straining eyes, into the kitchen\\n\\nbelow. I looked too, and both heard and saw the miller and two of his\\n\\nmen eagerly and loudly talking about the old woman, who had not appeared\\n\\nas usual to make the fire in the stove, and prepare her master\\'s\\n\\nbreakfast, and who now, late on in the morning, had been found dead in\\n\\nher bed; whether from the effect of her master\\'s blows the night before,\\n\\nor from natural causes, who can tell? The miller\\'s conscience upbraided\\n\\nhim a little, I should say, for he was eagerly declaring his value for\\n\\nhis housekeeper, and repeating how often she had spoken of the happy\\n\\nlife she led with him. The men might have their doubts, but they did\\n\\nnot wish to offend the miller, and all agreed that the necessary steps\\n\\nshould be taken for a speedy funeral. And so they went out, leaving\\n\\nus in our loft, but so much alone, that, for the first time almost,\\n\\nwe ventured to speak freely, though still in a hushed voice, pausing\\n\\nto listen continually. Amante took a more cheerful view of the whole\\n\\noccurrence than I did. She said that, had the old woman lived, we should\\n\\nhave had to depart that morning, and that this quiet departure would\\n\\nhave been the best thing we could have had to hope for, as, in all\\n\\nprobability, the housekeeper would have told her master of us and of\\n\\nour resting-place, and this fact would, sooner or later, have been\\n\\nbrought to the knowledge of those from whom we most desired to keep it\\n\\nconcealed; but that now we had time to rest, and a shelter to rest in,\\n\\nduring the first hot pursuit, which we knew to a fatal certainty was\\n\\nbeing carried on. The remnants of our food, and the stored-up fruit,\\n\\nwould supply us with provision; the only thing to be feared was, that\\n\\nsomething might be required from the loft, and the miller or some one\\n\\nelse mount up in search of it. But even then, with a little arrangement\\n\\nof boxes and chests, one part might be so kept in shadow that we might\\n\\nyet escape observation. All this comforted me a little; but, I asked,\\n\\nhow were we ever to escape? The ladder was taken away, which was\\n\\nour only means of descent. But Amante replied that she could make a\\n\\nsufficient ladder of the rope lying coiled among other things, to drop\\n\\nus down the ten feet or so--with the advantage of its being portable, so\\n\\nthat we might carry it away, and thus avoid all betrayal of the fact\\n\\nthat any one had ever been hidden in the loft.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the two days that intervened before we did escape, Amante made\\n\\ngood use of her time. She looked into every box and chest during the\\n\\nman\\'s absence at his mill; and finding in one box an old suit of man\\'s\\n\\nclothes, which had probably belonged to the miller\\'s absent son, she put\\n\\nthem on to see if they would fit her; and, when she found that they did,\\n\\nshe cut her own hair to the shortness of a man\\'s, made me clip her black\\n\\neyebrows as close as though they had been shaved, and by cutting up old\\n\\ncorks into pieces such as would go into her cheeks, she altered both the\\n\\nshape of her face and her voice to a degree which I should not have\\n\\nbelieved possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll this time I lay like one stunned; my body resting, and renewing its\\n\\nstrength, but I myself in an almost idiotic state--else surely I could\\n\\nnot have taken the stupid interest which I remember I did in all Amante\\'s\\n\\nenergetic preparations for disguise. I absolutely recollect once the\\n\\nfeeling of a smile coming over my stiff face as some new exercise of her\\n\\ncleverness proved a success.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut towards the second day, she required me, too, to exert myself; and\\n\\nthen all my heavy despair returned. I let her dye my fair hair and\\n\\ncomplexion with the decaying shells of the stored-up walnuts, I let her\\n\\nblacken my teeth, and even voluntarily broke a front tooth the better\\n\\nto effect my disguise. But through it all I had no hope of evading my\\n\\nterrible husband. The third night the funeral was over, the drinking\\n\\nended, the guests gone; the miller put to bed by his men, being too\\n\\ndrunk to help himself. They stopped a little while in the kitchen,\\n\\ntalking and laughing about the new housekeeper likely to come; and they,\\n\\ntoo, went off, shutting, but not locking the door. Everything favoured\\n\\nus. Amante had tried her ladder on one of the two previous nights, and\\n\\ncould, by a dexterous throw from beneath, unfasten it from the hook to\\n\\nwhich it was fixed, when it had served its office; she made up a bundle\\n\\nof worthless old clothes in order that we might the better preserve our\\n\\ncharacters of a travelling pedlar and his wife; she stuffed a hump on\\n\\nher back, she thickened my figure, she left her own clothes deep down\\n\\nbeneath a heap of others in the chest from which she had taken the man\\'s\\n\\ndress which she wore; and with a few francs in her pocket--the sole\\n\\nmoney we had either of us had about us when we escaped--we let ourselves\\n\\ndown the ladder, unhooked it, and passed into the cold darkness of night\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had discussed the route which it would be well for us to take while\\n\\nwe lay perdues in our loft. Amante had told me then that her reason for\\n\\ninquiring, when we first left Les Rochers, by which way I had first been\\n\\nbrought to it, was to avoid the pursuit which she was sure would first\\n\\nbe made in the direction of Germany; but that now she thought we might\\n\\nreturn to that district of country where my German fashion of speaking\\n\\nFrench would excite least observation. I thought that Amante herself had\\n\\nsomething peculiar in her accent, which I had heard M. de la Tourelle\\n\\nsneer at as Norman patois; but I said not a word beyond agreeing to her\\n\\nproposal that we should bend our steps towards Germany. Once there, we\\n\\nshould, I thought, be safe. Alas! I forgot the unruly time that was\\n\\noverspreading all Europe, overturning all law, and all the protection\\n\\nwhich law gives.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow we wandered--not daring to ask our way--how we lived, how we struggled\\n\\nthrough many a danger and still more terrors of danger, I shall not tell\\n\\nyou now. I will only relate two of our adventures before we reached\\n\\nFrankfort. The first, although fatal to an innocent lady, was yet, I\\n\\nbelieve, the cause of my safety; the second I shall tell you, that you\\n\\nmay understand why I did not return to my former home, as I had hoped to\\n\\ndo when we lay in the miller\\'s loft, and I first became capable of\\n\\ngroping after an idea of what my future life might be. I cannot tell you\\n\\nhow much in these doubtings and wanderings I became attached to Amante.\\n\\nI have sometimes feared since, lest I cared for her only because she was\\n\\nso necessary to my own safety; but, no! it was not so; or not so only,\\n\\nor principally. She said once that she was flying for her own life as\\n\\nwell as for mine; but we dared not speak much on our danger, or on the\\n\\nhorrors that had gone before. We planned a little what was to be our\\n\\nfuture course; but even for that we did not look forward long; how could\\n\\nwe, when every day we scarcely knew if we should see the sun go down?\\n\\nFor Amante knew or conjectured far more than I did of the atrocity of\\n\\nthe gang to which M. de la Tourelle belonged; and every now and then,\\n\\njust as we seemed to be sinking into the calm of security, we fell upon\\n\\ntraces of a pursuit after us in all directions. Once I remember--we must\\n\\nhave been nearly three weeks wearily walking through unfrequented ways,\\n\\nday after day, not daring to make inquiry as to our whereabouts, nor\\n\\nyet to seem purposeless in our wanderings--we came to a kind of lonely\\n\\nroadside farrier\\'s and blacksmith\\'s. I was so tired, that Amante\\n\\ndeclared that, come what might, we would stay there all night; and\\n\\naccordingly she entered the house, and boldly announced herself as a\\n\\ntravelling tailor, ready to do any odd jobs of work that might be\\n\\nrequired, for a night\\'s lodging and food for herself and wife. She had\\n\\nadopted this plan once or twice before, and with good success; for her\\n\\nfather had been a tailor in Rouen, and as a girl she had often helped\\n\\nhim with his work, and knew the tailors\\' slang and habits, down to the\\n\\nparticular whistle and cry which in France tells so much to those of a\\n\\ntrade. At this blacksmith\\'s, as at most other solitary houses far away\\n\\nfrom a town, there was not only a store of men\\'s clothes laid by as\\n\\nwanting mending when the housewife could afford time, but there was a\\n\\nnatural craving after news from a distance, such news as a wandering\\n\\ntailor is bound to furnish. The early November afternoon was closing\\n\\ninto evening, as we sat down, she cross-legged on the great table in the\\n\\nblacksmith\\'s kitchen, drawn close to the window, I close behind her,\\n\\nsewing at another part of the same garment, and from time to time well\\n\\nscolded by my seeming husband. All at once she turned round to speak to\\n\\nme. It was only one word, \"Courage!\" I had seen nothing; I sat out of\\n\\nthe light; but I turned sick for an instant, and then I braced myself up\\n\\ninto a strange strength of endurance to go through I knew not what.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacksmith\\'s forge was in a shed beside the house, and fronting the\\n\\nroad. I heard the hammers stop plying their continual rhythmical beat.\\n\\nShe had seen why they ceased. A rider had come up to the forge and\\n\\ndismounted, leading his horse in to be re-shod. The broad red light of\\n\\nthe forge-fire had revealed the face of the rider to Amante, and she\\n\\napprehended the consequence that really ensued.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rider, after some words with the blacksmith, was ushered in by him\\n\\ninto the house-place where we sat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here, good wife, a cup of wine and some galette for this gentleman.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anything, anything, madame, that I can eat and drink in my hand while\\n\\nmy horse is being shod. I am in haste, and must get on to Forbach\\n\\nto-night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blacksmith\\'s wife lighted her lamp; Amante had asked her for it five\\n\\nminutes before. How thankful we were that she had not more speedily\\n\\ncomplied with our request! As it was, we sat in dusk shadow, pretending\\n\\nto stitch away, but scarcely able to see. The lamp was placed on the\\n\\nstove, near which my husband, for it was he, stood and warmed himself.\\n\\nBy-and-by he turned round, and looked all over the room, taking us in\\n\\nwith about the same degree of interest as the inanimate furniture.\\n\\nAmante, cross-legged, fronting him, stooped over her work, whistling\\n\\nsoftly all the while. He turned again to the stove, impatiently rubbing\\n\\nhis hands. He had finished his wine and galette, and wanted to be off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am in haste, my good woman. Ask thy husband to get on more quickly. I\\n\\nwill pay him double if he makes haste.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe woman went out to do his bidding; and he once more turned round to\\n\\nface us. Amante went on to the second part of the tune. He took it up,\\n\\nwhistled a second for an instant or so, and then the blacksmith\\'s wife\\n\\nre-entering, he moved towards her, as if to receive her answer the more\\n\\nspeedily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"One moment, monsieur--only one moment. There was a nail out of the\\n\\noff-foreshoe which my husband is replacing; it would delay monsieur\\n\\nagain if that shoe also came off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Madame is right,\" said he, \"but my haste is urgent. If madame knew\\n\\nmy reasons, she would pardon my impatience. Once a happy husband, now\\n\\na deserted and betrayed man, I pursue a wife on whom I lavished all\\n\\nmy love, but who has abused my confidence, and fled from my house,\\n\\ndoubtless to some paramour; carrying off with her all the jewels and\\n\\nmoney on which she could lay her hands. It is possible madame may have\\n\\nheard or seen something of her; she was accompanied in her flight by\\n\\na base, profligate woman from Paris, whom I, unhappy man, had myself\\n\\nengaged for my wife\\'s waiting-maid, little dreaming what corruption I\\n\\nwas bringing into my house!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is it possible?\" said the good woman, throwing up her hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmante went on whistling a little lower, out of respect to the\\n\\nconversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"However, I am tracing the wicked fugitives; I am on their track\" (and\\n\\nthe handsome, effeminate face looked as ferocious as any demon\\'s). \"They\\n\\nwill not escape me; but every minute is a minute of misery to me, till I\\n\\nmeet my wife. Madame has sympathy, has she not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe drew his face into a hard, unnatural smile, and then both went out to\\n\\nthe forge, as if once more to hasten the blacksmith over his work.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmante stopped her whistling for one instant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go on as you are, without change of an eyelid even; in a few minutes he\\n\\nwill be gone, and it will be over!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a necessary caution, for I was on the point of giving way, and\\n\\nthrowing myself weakly upon her neck. We went on; she whistling and\\n\\nstitching, I making semblance to sew. And it was well we did so; for\\n\\nalmost directly he came back for his whip, which he had laid down and\\n\\nforgotten; and again I felt one of those sharp, quick-scanning glances,\\n\\nsent all round the room, and taking in all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen we heard him ride away; and then, it had been long too dark to see\\n\\nwell, I dropped my work, and gave way to my trembling and shuddering.\\n\\nThe blacksmith\\'s wife returned. She was a good creature. Amante told her\\n\\nI was cold and weary, and she insisted on my stopping my work, and going\\n\\nto sit near the stove; hastening, at the same time, her preparations for\\n\\nsupper, which, in honour of us, and of monsieur\\'s liberal payment, was\\n\\nto be a little less frugal than ordinary. It was well for me that she\\n\\nmade me taste a little of the cider-soup she was preparing, or I could\\n\\nnot have held up, in spite of Amante\\'s warning look, and the remembrance\\n\\nof her frequent exhortations to act resolutely up to the characters we\\n\\nhad assumed, whatever befel. To cover my agitation, Amante stopped her\\n\\nwhistling, and began to talk; and, by the time the blacksmith came in,\\n\\nshe and the good woman of the house were in full flow. He began at once\\n\\nupon the handsome gentleman, who had paid him so well; all his sympathy\\n\\nwas with him, and both he and his wife only wished he might overtake his\\n\\nwicked wife, and punish her as she deserved. And then the conversation\\n\\ntook a turn, not uncommon to those whose lives are quiet and monotonous;\\n\\nevery one seemed to vie with each other in telling about some horror;\\n\\nand the savage and mysterious band of robbers called the Chauffeurs,\\n\\nwho infested all the roads leading to the Rhine, with Schinderhannes at\\n\\ntheir head, furnished many a tale which made the very marrow of my bones\\n\\nrun cold, and quenched even Amante\\'s power of talking. Her eyes grew\\n\\nlarge and wild, her cheeks blanched, and for once she sought by her\\n\\nlooks help from me. The new call upon me roused me. I rose and said,\\n\\nwith their permission my husband and I would seek our bed, for that we\\n\\nhad travelled far and were early risers. I added that we would get up\\n\\nbetimes, and finish our piece of work. The blacksmith said we should\\n\\nbe early birds if we rose before him; and the good wife seconded my\\n\\nproposal with kindly bustle. One other such story as those they had been\\n\\nrelating, and I do believe Amante would have fainted.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs it was, a night\\'s rest set her up; we arose and finished our work\\n\\nbetimes, and shared the plentiful breakfast of the family. Then we had\\n\\nto set forth again; only knowing that to Forbach we must not go, yet\\n\\nbelieving, as was indeed the case, that Forbach lay between us and that\\n\\nGermany to which we were directing our course. Two days more we wandered\\n\\non, making a round, I suspect, and returning upon the road to Forbach, a\\n\\nleague or two nearer to that town than the blacksmith\\'s house. But as we\\n\\nnever made inquiries I hardly knew where we were, when we came one night\\n\\nto a small town, with a good large rambling inn in the very centre of\\n\\nthe principal street. We had begun to feel as if there were more safety\\n\\nin towns than in the loneliness of the country. As we had parted with a\\n\\nring of mine not many days before to a travelling jeweller, who was too\\n\\nglad to purchase it far below its real value to make many inquiries as\\n\\nto how it came into the possession of a poor working tailor, such as\\n\\nAmante seemed to be, we resolved to stay at this inn all night, and\\n\\ngather such particulars and information as we could by which to direct\\n\\nour onward course.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe took our supper in the darkest corner of the _salle--manger_, having\\n\\npreviously bargained for a small bedroom across the court, and over the\\n\\nstables. We needed food sorely; but we hurried on our meal from dread of\\n\\nany one entering that public room who might recognize us. Just in the\\n\\nmiddle of our meal, the public diligence drove lumbering up under the\\n\\n_porte-cochre_, and disgorged its passengers. Most of them turned into\\n\\nthe room where we sat, cowering and fearful, for the door was opposite\\n\\nto the porter\\'s lodge, and both opened on to the wide-covered entrance\\n\\nfrom the street. Among the passengers came in a young, fair-haired lady,\\n\\nattended by an elderly French maid. The poor young creature tossed her\\n\\nhead, and shrank away from the common room, full of evil smells and\\n\\npromiscuous company, and demanded, in German French, to be taken to\\n\\nsome private apartment. We heard that she and her maid had come in the\\n\\ncoup, and, probably from pride, poor young lady! she had avoided all\\n\\nassociation with her fellow-passengers, thereby exciting their dislike\\n\\nand ridicule. All these little pieces of hearsay had a significance to\\n\\nus afterwards, though, at the time, the only remark made that bore upon\\n\\nthe future was Amante\\'s whisper to me that the young lady\\'s hair was\\n\\nexactly the colour of mine, which she had cut off and burnt in the stove\\n\\nin the miller\\'s kitchen in one of her descents from our hiding-place in\\n\\nthe loft.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as we could, we struck round in the shadow, leaving the\\n\\nboisterous and merry fellow-passengers to their supper. We crossed the\\n\\ncourt, borrowed a lantern from the ostler, and scrambled up the rude\\n\\nsteps to our chamber above the stable. There was no door into it; the\\n\\nentrance was the hole into which the ladder fitted. The window looked\\n\\ninto the court. We were tired and soon fell asleep. I was wakened by a\\n\\nnoise in the stable below. One instant of listening, and I wakened\\n\\nAmante, placing my hand on her mouth, to prevent any exclamation in her\\n\\nhalf-roused state. We heard my husband speaking about his horse to the\\n\\nostler. It was his voice. I am sure of it. Amante said so too. We durst\\n\\nnot move to rise and satisfy ourselves. For five minutes or so he went\\n\\non giving directions. Then he left the stable, and, softly stealing\\n\\nto our window, we saw him cross the court and re-enter the inn. We\\n\\nconsulted as to what we should do. We feared to excite remark or\\n\\nsuspicion by descending and leaving our chamber, or else immediate\\n\\nescape was our strongest idea. Then the ostler left the stable, locking\\n\\nthe door on the outside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must try and drop through the window--if, indeed, it is well to go\\n\\nat all,\" said Amante.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith reflection came wisdom. We should excite suspicion by leaving\\n\\nwithout paying our bill. We were on foot, and might easily be pursued.\\n\\nSo we sat on our bed\\'s edge, talking and shivering, while from across\\n\\nthe court the laughter rang merrily, and the company slowly dispersed\\n\\none by one, their lights flitting past the windows as they went upstairs\\n\\nand settled each one to his rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe crept into our bed, holding each other tight, and listening to every\\n\\nsound, as if we thought we were tracked, and might meet our death at any\\n\\nmoment. In the dead of night, just at the profound stillness preceding\\n\\nthe turn into another day, we heard a soft, cautious step crossing\\n\\nthe yard. The key into the stable was turned--some one came into the\\n\\nstable--we felt rather than heard him there. A horse started a little,\\n\\nand made a restless movement with his feet, then whinnied recognition.\\n\\nHe who had entered made two or three low sounds to the animal, and then\\n\\nled him into the court. Amante sprang to the window with the noiseless\\n\\nactivity of a cat. She looked out, but dared not speak a word. We heard\\n\\nthe great door into the street open--a pause for mounting, and the\\n\\nhorse\\'s footsteps were lost in distance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Amante came back to me. \"It was he! he is gone!\" said she, and once\\n\\nmore we lay down, trembling and shaking.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time we fell sound asleep. We slept long and late. We were wakened\\n\\nby many hurrying feet, and many confused voices; all the world seemed\\n\\nawake and astir. We rose and dressed ourselves, and coming down we\\n\\nlooked around among the crowd collected in the court-yard, in order to\\n\\nassure ourselves _he_ was not there before we left the shelter of the\\n\\nstable.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instant we were seen, two or three people rushed to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you heard?--Do you know?--That poor young lady--oh, come and see!\"\\n\\nand so we were hurried, almost in spite of ourselves, across the court,\\n\\nand up the great open stairs of the main building of the inn, into a\\n\\nbed-chamber, where lay the beautiful young German lady, so full of\\n\\ngraceful pride the night before, now white and still in death. By her\\n\\nstood the French maid, crying and gesticulating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, madame! if you had but suffered me to stay with you! Oh! the baron,\\n\\nwhat will he say?\" and so she went on. Her state had but just been\\n\\ndiscovered; it had been supposed that she was fatigued, and was sleeping\\n\\nlate, until a few minutes before. The surgeon of the town had been sent\\n\\nfor, and the landlord of the inn was trying vainly to enforce order\\n\\nuntil he came, and, from time to time, drinking little cups of brandy,\\n\\nand offering them to the guests, who were all assembled there, pretty\\n\\nmuch as the servants were doing in the court-yard.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the surgeon came. All fell back, and hung on the words that were\\n\\nto fall from his lips.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"See!\" said the landlord. \"This lady came last night by the diligence\\n\\nwith her maid. Doubtless a great lady, for she must have a private\\n\\nsitting-room----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She was Madame the Baroness de Roeder,\" said the French maid.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\"And was difficult to please in the matter of supper, and a\\n\\nsleeping-room. She went to bed well, though fatigued. Her maid left\\n\\nher----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I begged to be allowed to sleep in her room, as we were in a strange\\n\\ninn, of the character of which we knew nothing; but she would not let\\n\\nme, my mistress was such a great lady.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n--\"And slept with my servants,\" continued the landlord. \"This morning we\\n\\nthought madame was still slumbering; but when eight, nine, ten, and near\\n\\neleven o\\'clock came, I bade her maid use my pass-key, and enter her\\n\\nroom----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The door was not locked, only closed. And here she was found--dead is\\n\\nshe not, monsieur?--with her face down on her pillow, and her beautiful\\n\\nhair all scattered wild; she never would let me tie it up, saying it\\n\\nmade her head ache. Such hair!\" said the waiting-maid, lifting up a long\\n\\ngolden tress, and letting it fall again.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remembered Amante\\'s words the night before, and crept close up to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, the doctor was examining the body underneath the bed-clothes,\\n\\nwhich the landlord, until now, had not allowed to be disarranged. The\\n\\nsurgeon drew out his hand, all bathed and stained with blood; and\\n\\nholding up a short, sharp knife, with a piece of paper fastened round\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here has been foul play,\" he said. \"The deceased lady has been\\n\\nmurdered. This dagger was aimed straight at her heart.\" Then, putting on\\n\\nhis spectacles, he read the writing on the bloody paper, dimmed and\\n\\nhorribly obscured as it was:--\\n\\n\\n\\n  NUMRO UN.\\n\\n  Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let us go!\" said I to Amante. \"Oh, let us leave this horrible place!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait a little,\" said she. \"Only a few minutes more. It will be better.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately the voices of all proclaimed their suspicions of the\\n\\ncavalier who had arrived last the night before. He had, they said, made\\n\\nso many inquiries about the young lady, whose supercilious conduct all\\n\\nin the _salle--manger_ had been discussing on his entrance. They were\\n\\ntalking about her as we left the room; he must have come in directly\\n\\nafterwards, and not until he had learnt all about her, had he spoken of\\n\\nthe business which necessitated his departure at dawn of day, and made\\n\\nhis arrangements with both landlord and ostler for the possession of the\\n\\nkeys of the stable and _porte-cochre_. In short, there was no doubt as\\n\\nto the murderer, even before the arrival of the legal functionary who\\n\\nhad been sent for by the surgeon; but the word on the paper chilled\\n\\nevery one with terror. Les Chauffeurs, who were they? No one knew, some\\n\\nof the gang might even then be in the room overhearing, and noting down\\n\\nfresh objects for vengeance. In Germany, I had heard little of this\\n\\nterrible gang, and I had paid no greater heed to the stories related\\n\\nonce or twice about them in Carlsruhe than one does to tales about\\n\\nogres. But here in their very haunts, I learnt the full amount of the\\n\\nterror they inspired. No one would be legally responsible for any\\n\\nevidence criminating the murderer. The public prosecutor shrank from the\\n\\nduties of his office. What do I say? Neither Amante nor I, knowing far\\n\\nmore of the actual guilt of the man who had killed that poor sleeping\\n\\nyoung lady, durst breathe a word. We appeared to be wholly ignorant of\\n\\neverything: we, who might have told so much. But how could we? we were\\n\\nbroken down with terrific anxiety and fatigue, with the knowledge that\\n\\nwe, above all, were doomed victims; and that the blood, heavily dripping\\n\\nfrom the bed-clothes on to the floor, was dripping thus out of the poor\\n\\ndead body, because, when living, she had been mistaken for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length Amante went up to the landlord, and asked permission to leave\\n\\nhis inn, doing all openly and humbly, so as to excite neither ill-will\\n\\nnor suspicion. Indeed, suspicion was otherwise directed, and he willingly\\n\\ngave us leave to depart. A few days afterwards we were across the Rhine,\\n\\nin Germany, making our way towards Frankfort, but still keeping our\\n\\ndisguises, and Amante still working at her trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the way, we met a young man, a wandering journeyman from Heidelberg.\\n\\nI knew him, although I did not choose that he should know me. I asked\\n\\nhim, as carelessly as I could, how the old miller was now? He told me he\\n\\nwas dead. This realization of the worst apprehensions caused by his long\\n\\nsilence shocked me inexpressibly. It seemed as though every prop gave\\n\\nway from under me. I had been talking to Amante only that very day of\\n\\nthe safety and comfort of the home that awaited her in my father\\'s\\n\\nhouse; of the gratitude which the old man would feel towards her; and\\n\\nhow there, in that peaceful dwelling, far away from the terrible land\\n\\nof France, she should find ease and security for all the rest of her\\n\\nlife. All this I thought I had to promise, and even yet more had I\\n\\nlooked for, for myself. I looked to the unburdening of my heart and\\n\\nconscience by telling all I knew to my best and wisest friend. I looked\\n\\nto his love as a sure guidance as well as a comforting stay, and,\\n\\nbehold, he was gone away from me for ever!\\n\\n\\n\\nI had left the room hastily on hearing of this sad news from the\\n\\nHeidelberger. Presently, Amante followed:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Poor madame,\" said she, consoling me to the best of her ability. And\\n\\nthen she told me by degrees what more she had learned respecting my\\n\\nhome, about which she knew almost as much as I did, from my frequent\\n\\ntalks on the subject both at Les Rochers and on the dreary, doleful road\\n\\nwe had come along. She had continued the conversation after I left, by\\n\\nasking about my brother and his wife. Of course, they lived on at the\\n\\nmill, but the man said (with what truth I know not, but I believed it\\n\\nfirmly at the time) that Babette had completely got the upper hand of my\\n\\nbrother, who only saw through her eyes and heard with her ears. That\\n\\nthere had been much Heidelberg gossip of late days about her sudden\\n\\nintimacy with a grand French gentleman who had appeared at the mill--a\\n\\nrelation, by marriage--married, in fact, to the miller\\'s sister, who,\\n\\nby all accounts, had behaved abominably and ungratefully. But that was\\n\\nno reason for Babette\\'s extreme and sudden intimacy with him, going\\n\\nabout everywhere with the French gentleman; and since he left (as the\\n\\nHeidelberger said he knew for a fact) corresponding with him constantly.\\n\\nYet her husband saw no harm in it all, seemingly; though, to be sure, he\\n\\nwas so out of spirits, what with his father\\'s death and the news of his\\n\\nsister\\'s infamy, that he hardly knew how to hold up his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Amante, \"all this proves that M. de la Tourelle has\\n\\nsuspected that you would go back to the nest in which you were reared,\\n\\nand that he has been there, and found that you have not yet returned;\\n\\nbut probably he still imagines that you will do so, and has accordingly\\n\\nengaged your sister-in-law as a kind of informant. Madame has said that\\n\\nher sister-in-law bore her no extreme good-will; and the defamatory\\n\\nstory he has got the start of us in spreading, will not tend to increase\\n\\nthe favour in which your sister-in-law holds you. No doubt the assassin\\n\\nwas retracing his steps when we met him near Forbach, and having heard\\n\\nof the poor German lady, with her French maid, and her pretty blonde\\n\\ncomplexion, he followed her. If madame will still be guided by me--and,\\n\\nmy child, I beg of you still to trust me,\" said Amante, breaking out of\\n\\nher respectful formality into the way of talking more natural to those\\n\\nwho had shared and escaped from common dangers--more natural, too, where\\n\\nthe speaker was conscious of a power of protection which the other did\\n\\nnot possess--\"we will go on to Frankfort, and lose ourselves, for a\\n\\ntime, at least, in the numbers of people who throng a great town; and\\n\\nyou have told me that Frankfort is a great town. We will still be\\n\\nhusband and wife; we will take a small lodging, and you shall housekeep\\n\\nand live in-doors. I, as the rougher and the more alert, will continue\\n\\nmy father\\'s trade, and seek work at the tailors\\' shops.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI could think of no better plan, so we followed this out. In a back\\n\\nstreet at Frankfort we found two furnished rooms to let on a sixth\\n\\nstory. The one we entered had no light from day; a dingy lamp swung\\n\\nperpetually from the ceiling, and from that, or from the open door\\n\\nleading into the bedroom beyond, came our only light. The bedroom was\\n\\nmore cheerful, but very small. Such as it was, it almost exceeded our\\n\\npossible means. The money from the sale of my ring was almost exhausted,\\n\\nand Amante was a stranger in the place, speaking only French, moreover,\\n\\nand the good Germans were hating the French people right heartily.\\n\\nHowever, we succeeded better than our hopes, and even laid by a little\\n\\nagainst the time of my confinement. I never stirred abroad, and saw no\\n\\none, and Amante\\'s want of knowledge of German kept her in a state of\\n\\ncomparative isolation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length my child was born--my poor worse than fatherless child. It\\n\\nwas a girl, as I had prayed for. I had feared lest a boy might have\\n\\nsomething of the tiger nature of its father, but a girl seemed all my\\n\\nown. And yet not all my own, for the faithful Amante\\'s delight and glory\\n\\nin the babe almost exceeded mine; in outward show it certainly did.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had not been able to afford any attendance beyond what a neighbouring\\n\\nsage-femme could give, and she came frequently, bringing in with her\\n\\na little store of gossip, and wonderful tales culled out of her own\\n\\nexperience, every time. One day she began to tell me about a great lady\\n\\nin whose service her daughter had lived as scullion, or some such\\n\\nthing. Such a beautiful lady! with such a handsome husband. But grief\\n\\ncomes to the palace as well as to the garret, and why or wherefore no\\n\\none knew, but somehow the Baron de Roeder must have incurred the\\n\\nvengeance of the terrible Chauffeurs; for not many months ago, as\\n\\nmadame was going to see her relations in Alsace, she was stabbed dead\\n\\nas she lay in bed at some hotel on the road. Had I not seen it in the\\n\\n_Gazette_? Had I not heard? Why, she had been told that as far off as\\n\\nLyons there were placards offering a heavy reward on the part of the\\n\\nBaron de Roeder for information respecting the murderer of his wife. But\\n\\nno one could help him, for all who could bear evidence were in such\\n\\nterror of the Chauffeurs; there were hundreds of them she had been told,\\n\\nrich and poor, great gentlemen and peasants, all leagued together by\\n\\nmost frightful oaths to hunt to the death any one who bore witness\\n\\nagainst them; so that even they who survived the tortures to which the\\n\\nChauffeurs subjected many of the people whom they plundered, dared not\\n\\nto recognise them again, would not dare, even did they see them at the\\n\\nbar of a court of justice; for, if one were condemned, were there not\\n\\nhundreds sworn to avenge his death?\\n\\n\\n\\nI told all this to Amante, and we began to fear that if M. de la\\n\\nTourelle, or Lefebvre, or any of the gang at Les Rochers, had seen these\\n\\nplacards, they would know that the poor lady stabbed by the former was\\n\\nthe Baroness de Roeder, and that they would set forth again in search of\\n\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis fresh apprehension told on my health and impeded my recovery. We\\n\\nhad so little money we could not call in a physician, at least, not one\\n\\nin established practice. But Amante found out a young doctor for whom,\\n\\nindeed, she had sometimes worked; and offering to pay him in kind, she\\n\\nbrought him to see me, her sick wife. He was very gentle and thoughtful,\\n\\nthough, like ourselves, very poor. But he gave much time and consideration\\n\\nto the case, saying once to Amante that he saw my constitution had\\n\\nexperienced some severe shock from which it was probable that my nerves\\n\\nwould never entirely recover. By-and-by I shall name this doctor, and\\n\\nthen you will know, better than I can describe, his character.\\n\\n\\n\\nI grew strong in time--stronger, at least. I was able to work a little\\n\\nat home, and to sun myself and my baby at the garret-window in the roof.\\n\\nIt was all the air I dared to take. I constantly wore the disguise I had\\n\\nfirst set out with; as constantly had I renewed the disfiguring dye\\n\\nwhich changed my hair and complexion. But the perpetual state of terror\\n\\nin which I had been during the whole months succeeding my escape from\\n\\nLes Rochers made me loathe the idea of ever again walking in the open\\n\\ndaylight, exposed to the sight and recognition of every passer-by. In\\n\\nvain Amante reasoned--in vain the doctor urged. Docile in every other\\n\\nthing, in this I was obstinate. I would not stir out. One day Amante\\n\\nreturned from her work, full of news--some of it good, some such as to\\n\\ncause us apprehension. The good news was this; the master for whom she\\n\\nworked as journeyman was going to send her with some others to a great\\n\\nhouse at the other side of Frankfort, where there were to be private\\n\\ntheatricals, and where many new dresses and much alteration of old ones\\n\\nwould be required. The tailors employed were all to stay at this house\\n\\nuntil the day of representation was over, as it was at some distance\\n\\nfrom the town, and no one could tell when their work would be ended.\\n\\nBut the pay was to be proportionately good.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other thing she had to say was this: she had that day met the\\n\\ntravelling jeweller to whom she and I had sold my ring. It was rather a\\n\\npeculiar one, given to me by my husband; we had felt at the time that it\\n\\nmight be the means of tracing us, but we were penniless and starving,\\n\\nand what else could we do? She had seen that this Frenchman had recognised\\n\\nher at the same instant that she did him, and she thought at the same\\n\\ntime that there was a gleam of more than common intelligence on his face\\n\\nas he did so. This idea had been confirmed by his following her for some\\n\\nway on the other side of the street; but she had evaded him with her\\n\\nbetter knowledge of the town, and the increasing darkness of the night.\\n\\nStill it was well that she was going to such a distance from our\\n\\ndwelling on the next day; and she had brought me in a stock of provisions,\\n\\nbegging me to keep within doors, with a strange kind of fearful oblivion\\n\\nof the fact that I had never set foot beyond the threshold of the house\\n\\nsince I had first entered it--scarce ever ventured down the stairs. But,\\n\\nalthough my poor, my dear, very faithful Amante was like one possessed\\n\\nthat last night, she spoke continually of the dead, which is a bad\\n\\nsign for the living. She kissed you--yes! it was you, my daughter, my\\n\\ndarling, whom I bore beneath my bosom away from the fearful castle of\\n\\nyour father--I call him so for the first time, I must call him so once\\n\\nagain before I have done--Amante kissed you, sweet baby, blessed little\\n\\ncomforter, as if she never could leave off. And then she went away,\\n\\nalive.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo days, three days passed away. That third evening I was sitting\\n\\nwithin my bolted doors--you asleep on your pillow by my side--when a\\n\\nstep came up the stair, and I knew it must be for me; for ours were the\\n\\ntopmost rooms. Some one knocked; I held my very breath. But some one\\n\\nspoke, and I knew it was the good Doctor Voss. Then I crept to the door,\\n\\nand answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you alone?\" asked I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, in a still lower voice. \"Let me in.\" I let him in, and\\n\\nhe was as alert as I in bolting and barring the door. Then he came and\\n\\nwhispered to me his doleful tale. He had come from the hospital in the\\n\\nopposite quarter of the town, the hospital which he visited; he should\\n\\nhave been with me sooner, but he had feared lest he should be watched.\\n\\nHe had come from Amante\\'s death-bed. Her fears of the jeweller were\\n\\ntoo well founded. She had left the house where she was employed that\\n\\nmorning, to transact some errand connected with her work in the town;\\n\\nshe must have been followed, and dogged on her way back through solitary\\n\\nwood-paths, for some of the wood-rangers belonging to the great house\\n\\nhad found her lying there, stabbed to death, but not dead; with the\\n\\nponiard again plunged through the fatal writing, once more; but this\\n\\ntime with the word \"un\" underlined, so as to show that the assassin was\\n\\naware of his previous mistake.\\n\\n\\n\\n  Numro _Un_.\\n\\n  Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had carried her to the house, and given her restoratives till she\\n\\nhad recovered the feeble use of her speech. But, oh, faithful, dear\\n\\nfriend and sister! even then she remembered me, and refused to tell\\n\\n(what no one else among her fellow workmen knew), where she lived or\\n\\nwith whom. Life was ebbing away fast, and they had no resource but to\\n\\ncarry her to the nearest hospital, where, of course, the fact of her\\n\\nsex was made known. Fortunately both for her and for me, the doctor in\\n\\nattendance was the very Doctor Voss whom we already knew. To him, while\\n\\nawaiting her confessor, she told enough to enable him to understand the\\n\\nposition in which I was left; before the priest had heard half her tale\\n\\nAmante was dead.\\n\\n\\n\\nDoctor Voss told me he had made all sorts of _dtours_, and waited thus,\\n\\nlate at night, for fear of being watched and followed. But I do not\\n\\nthink he was. At any rate, as I afterwards learnt from him, the Baron\\n\\nRoeder, on hearing of the similitude of this murder with that of his\\n\\nwife in every particular, made such a search after the assassins, that,\\n\\nalthough they were not discovered, they were compelled to take to flight\\n\\nfor the time.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can hardly tell you now by what arguments Dr. Voss, at first merely\\n\\nmy benefactor, sparing me a portion of his small modicum, at length\\n\\npersuaded me to become his wife. His wife he called it, I called it; for\\n\\nwe went through the religious ceremony too much slighted at the time,\\n\\nand as we were both Lutherans, and M. de la Tourelle had pretended to be\\n\\nof the reformed religion, a divorce from the latter would have been\\n\\neasily procurable by German law both ecclesiastical and legal, could we\\n\\nhave summoned so fearful a man into any court.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good doctor took me and my child by stealth to his modest dwelling;\\n\\nand there I lived in the same deep retirement, never seeing the full\\n\\nlight of day, although when the dye had once passed away from my face my\\n\\nhusband did not wish me to renew it. There was no need; my yellow hair\\n\\nwas grey, my complexion was ashen-coloured, no creature could have\\n\\nrecognized the fresh-coloured, bright-haired young woman of eighteen\\n\\nmonths before. The few people whom I saw knew me only as Madame Voss; a\\n\\nwidow much older than himself, whom Dr. Voss had secretly married. They\\n\\ncalled me the Grey Woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made me give you his surname. Till now you have known no other\\n\\nfather--while he lived you needed no father\\'s love. Once only, only once\\n\\nmore, did the old terror come upon me. For some reason which I forget,\\n\\nI broke through my usual custom, and went to the window of my room for\\n\\nsome purpose, either to shut or to open it. Looking out into the street\\n\\nfor an instant, I was fascinated by the sight of M. de la Tourelle, gay,\\n\\nyoung, elegant as ever, walking along on the opposite side of the\\n\\nstreet. The noise I had made with the window caused him to look up; he\\n\\nsaw me, an old grey woman, and he did not recognize me! Yet it was not\\n\\nthree years since we had parted, and his eyes were keen and dreadful\\n\\nlike those of the lynx.\\n\\n\\n\\nI told M. Voss, on his return home, and he tried to cheer me, but the\\n\\nshock of seeing M. de la Tourelle had been too terrible for me. I was\\n\\nill for long months afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce again I saw him. Dead. He and Lefebvre were at last caught; hunted\\n\\ndown by the Baron de Roeder in some of their crimes. Dr. Voss had heard\\n\\nof their arrest; their condemnation, their death; but he never said a\\n\\nword to me, until one day he bade me show him that I loved him by my\\n\\nobedience and my trust. He took me a long carriage journey, where to I\\n\\nknow not, for we never spoke of that day again; I was led through a\\n\\nprison, into a closed court-yard, where, decently draped in the last\\n\\nrobes of death, concealing the marks of decapitation, lay M. de la\\n\\nTourelle, and two or three others, whom I had known at Les Rochers.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that conviction Dr. Voss tried to persuade me to return to a more\\n\\nnatural mode of life, and to go out more. But although I sometimes\\n\\ncomplied with his wish, yet the old terror was ever strong upon me,\\n\\nand he, seeing what an effort it was, gave up urging me at last.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know all the rest. How we both mourned bitterly the loss of that\\n\\ndear husband and father--for such I will call him ever--and as such\\n\\nyou must consider him, my child, after this one revelation is over.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy has it been made, you ask. For this reason, my child. The lover,\\n\\nwhom you have only known as M. Lebrun, a French artist, told me but\\n\\nyesterday his real name, dropped because the blood-thirsty republicans\\n\\nmight consider it as too aristocratic. It is Maurice de Poissy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCURIOUS IF TRUE.\\n\\n\\n\\n(EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM RICHARD WHITTINGHAM, ESQ.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou were formerly so much amused at my pride in my descent from that\\n\\nsister of Calvin\\'s, who married a Whittingham, Dean of Durham, that I\\n\\ndoubt if you will be able to enter into the regard for my distinguished\\n\\nrelation that has led me to France, in order to examine registers and\\n\\narchives, which, I thought, might enable me to discover collateral\\n\\ndescendants of the great reformer, with whom I might call cousins. I\\n\\nshall not tell you of my troubles and adventures in this research; you\\n\\nare not worthy to hear of them; but something so curious befel me one\\n\\nevening last August, that if I had not been perfectly certain I was wide\\n\\nawake, I might have taken it for a dream.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the purpose I have named, it was necessary that I should make Tours\\n\\nmy head-quarters for a time. I had traced descendants of the Calvin\\n\\nfamily out of Normandy into the centre of France; but I found it was\\n\\nnecessary to have a kind of permission from the bishop of the diocese\\n\\nbefore I could see certain family papers, which had fallen into the\\n\\npossession of the Church; and, as I had several English friends at\\n\\nTours, I awaited the answer to my request to Monseigneur de ----, at\\n\\nthat town. I was ready to accept any invitation; but I received very\\n\\nfew; and was sometimes a little at a loss what to do with my evenings.\\n\\nThe _table d\\'hte_ was at five o\\'clock; I did not wish to go to the\\n\\nexpense of a private sitting-room, disliked the dinnery atmosphere of\\n\\nthe _salle  manger_, could not play either at pool or billiards, and\\n\\nthe aspect of my fellow guests was unprepossessing enough to make me\\n\\nunwilling to enter into any _tte--tte_ gamblings with them. So I\\n\\nusually rose from table early, and tried to make the most of the\\n\\nremaining light of the August evenings in walking briskly off to explore\\n\\nthe surrounding country; the middle of the day was too hot for this\\n\\npurpose, and better employed in lounging on a bench in the Boulevards,\\n\\nlazily listening to the distant band, and noticing with equal laziness\\n\\nthe faces and figures of the women who passed by.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was, I think, I had gone\\n\\nfurther than usual in my walk, and I found that it was later than I\\n\\nhad imagined when I paused to turn back. I fancied I could make a round;\\n\\nI had enough notion of the direction in which I was, to see that by\\n\\nturning up a narrow straight lane to my left I should shorten my way\\n\\nback to Tours. And so I believe I should have done, could I have found\\n\\nan outlet at the right place, but field-paths are almost unknown in\\n\\nthat part of France, and my lane, stiff and straight as any street, and\\n\\nmarked into terribly vanishing perspective by the regular row of poplars\\n\\non each side, seemed interminable. Of course night came on, and I was\\n\\nin darkness. In England I might have had a chance of seeing a light\\n\\nin some cottage only a field or two off, and asking my way from the\\n\\ninhabitants; but here I could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I\\n\\nbelieve French peasants go to bed with the summer daylight, so if there\\n\\nwere any habitations in the neighbourhood I never saw them. At last--I\\n\\nbelieve I must have walked two hours in the darkness,--I saw the dusky\\n\\noutline of a wood on one side of the weariful lane, and, impatiently\\n\\ncareless of all forest laws and penalties for trespassers, I made my\\n\\nway to it, thinking that if the worst came to the worst, I could find\\n\\nsome covert--some shelter where I could lie down and rest, until the\\n\\nmorning light gave me a chance of finding my way back to Tours. But the\\n\\nplantation, on the outskirts of what appeared to me a dense wood, was of\\n\\nyoung trees, too closely planted to be more than slender stems growing\\n\\nup to a good height, with scanty foliage on their summits. On I went\\n\\ntowards the thicker forest, and once there I slackened my pace, and\\n\\nbegan to look about me for a good lair. I was as dainty as Lochiel\\'s\\n\\ngrandchild, who made his grandsire indignant at the luxury of his pillow\\n\\nof snow: this brake was too full of brambles, that felt damp with dew;\\n\\nthere was no hurry, since I had given up all hope of passing the night\\n\\nbetween four walls; and I went leisurely groping about, and trusting\\n\\nthat there were no wolves to be poked up out of their summer drowsiness\\n\\nby my stick, when all at once I saw a chteau before me, not a quarter\\n\\nof a mile off, at the end of what seemed to be an ancient avenue (now\\n\\novergrown and irregular), which I happened to be crossing, when I looked\\n\\nto my right, and saw the welcome sight. Large, stately, and dark was\\n\\nits outline against the dusky night-sky; there were pepper-boxes and\\n\\ntourelles and what-not fantastically going up into the dim starlight.\\n\\nAnd more to the purpose still, though I could not see the details of the\\n\\nbuilding that I was now facing, it was plain enough that there were\\n\\nlights in many windows, as if some great entertainment was going on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are hospitable people, at any rate,\" thought I. \"Perhaps they\\n\\nwill give me a bed. I don\\'t suppose French propritaires have traps and\\n\\nhorses quite as plentiful as English gentlemen; but they are evidently\\n\\nhaving a large party, and some of their guests may be from Tours, and\\n\\nwill give me a cast back to the Lion d\\'Or. I am not proud, and I am\\n\\ndog-tired. I am not above hanging on behind, if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk, I went up to\\n\\nthe door, which was standing open, most hospitably, and showing a large\\n\\nlighted hall, all hung round with spoils of the chase, armour, &c, the\\n\\ndetails of which I had not time to notice, for the instant I stood on\\n\\nthe threshold a huge porter appeared, in a strange, old-fashioned dress,\\n\\na kind of livery which well befitted the general appearance of the house.\\n\\nHe asked me, in French (so curiously pronounced that I thought I had hit\\n\\nupon a new kind of _patois_), my name, and whence I came. I thought he\\n\\nwould not be much the wiser, still it was but civil to give it before I\\n\\nmade my request for assistance; so, in reply, I said--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My name is Whittingham--Richard Whittingham, an English gentleman,\\n\\nstaying at ----.\" To my infinite surprise, a light of pleased intelligence\\n\\ncame over the giant\\'s face; he made me a low bow, and said (still in\\n\\nthe same curious dialect) that I was welcome, that I was long expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Long expected!\" What could the fellow mean? Had I stumbled on a nest\\n\\nof relations by John Calvin\\'s side, who had heard of my genealogical\\n\\ninquiries, and were gratified and interested by them? But I was too\\n\\nmuch pleased to be under shelter for the night to think it necessary to\\n\\naccount for my agreeable reception before I enjoyed it. Just as he was\\n\\nopening the great heavy _battants_ of the door that led from the hall to\\n\\nthe interior, he turned round and said,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Apparently Monsieur le Ganquilleur is not come with you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,\"--and I was going on with my\\n\\nexplanation, when he, as if quite indifferent to it, led the way up\\n\\na great stone staircase, as wide as many rooms, and having on each\\n\\nlanding-place massive iron wickets, in a heavy framework; these the\\n\\nporter unlocked with the solemn slowness of age. Indeed, a strange,\\n\\nmysterious awe of the centuries that had passed away since this chteau\\n\\nwas built, came over me as I waited for the turning of the ponderous\\n\\nkeys in the ancient locks. I could almost have fancied that I heard a\\n\\nmighty rushing murmur (like the ceaseless sound of a distant sea, ebbing\\n\\nand flowing for ever and for ever), coming forth from the great vacant\\n\\ngalleries that opened out on each side of the broad staircase, and were\\n\\nto be dimly perceived in the darkness above us. It was as if the voices\\n\\nof generations of men yet echoed and eddied in the silent air. It was\\n\\nstrange, too, that my friend the porter going before me, ponderously\\n\\ninfirm, with his feeble old hands striving in vain to keep the tall\\n\\nflambeau he held steadily before him,--strange, I say, that he was the\\n\\nonly domestic I saw in the vast halls and passages, or met with on the\\n\\ngrand staircase. At length we stood before the gilded doors that led\\n\\ninto the saloon where the family--or it might be the company, so great\\n\\nwas the buzz of voices--was assembled. I would have remonstrated when\\n\\nI found he was going to introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a\\n\\nmorning costume that was not even my best, into this grand _salon_, with\\n\\nnobody knew how many ladies and gentlemen assembled; but the obstinate\\n\\nold man was evidently bent upon taking me straight to his master, and\\n\\npaid no heed to my words.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon curiously full of\\n\\npale light, which did not culminate on any spot, nor proceed from any\\n\\ncentre, nor flicker with any motion of the air, but filled every nook\\n\\nand corner, making all things deliciously distinct; different from our\\n\\nlight of gas or candle, as is the difference between a clear southern\\n\\natmosphere and that of our misty England.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the first moment, my arrival excited no attention, the apartment was\\n\\nso full of people, all intent on their own conversation. But my friend\\n\\nthe porter went up to a handsome lady of middle age, richly attired in\\n\\nthat antique manner which fashion has brought round again of late years,\\n\\nand, waiting first in an attitude of deep respect till her attention\\n\\nfell upon him, told her my name and something about me, as far as I\\n\\ncould guess from the gestures of the one and the sudden glance of the\\n\\neye of the other.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe immediately came towards me with the most friendly actions of\\n\\ngreeting, even before she had advanced near enough to speak. Then,--and\\n\\nwas it not strange?--her words and accent were that of the commonest\\n\\npeasant of the country. Yet she herself looked high-bred, and would have\\n\\nbeen dignified had she been a shade less restless, had her countenance\\n\\nworn a little less lively and inquisitive expression. I had been poking\\n\\na good deal about the old parts of Tours, and had had to understand the\\n\\ndialect of the people who dwelt in the March au Vendredi and similar\\n\\nplaces, or I really should not have understood my handsome hostess, as\\n\\nshe offered to present me to her husband, a henpecked, gentlemanly man,\\n\\nwho was more quaintly attired than she in the very extreme of that style\\n\\nof dress. I thought to myself that in France, as in England, it is the\\n\\nprovincials who carry fashion to such an excess as to become ridiculous.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, he spoke (still in the _patois_) of his pleasure in making my\\n\\nacquaintance, and led me to a strange uneasy easy-chair, much of a piece\\n\\nwith the rest of the furniture, which might have taken its place without\\n\\nany anachronism by the side of that in the Htel Cluny. Then again\\n\\nbegan the clatter of French voices, which my arrival had for an instant\\n\\ninterrupted, and I had leisure to look about me. Opposite to me sat a\\n\\nvery sweet-looking lady, who must have been a great beauty in her youth,\\n\\nI should think, and would be charming in old age, from the sweetness of\\n\\nher countenance. She was, however, extremely fat, and on seeing her feet\\n\\nlaid up before her on a cushion, I at once perceived that they were so\\n\\nswollen as to render her incapable of walking, which probably brought on\\n\\nher excessive _embonpoint_. Her hands were plump and small, but rather\\n\\ncoarse-grained in texture, not quite so clean as they might have been,\\n\\nand altogether not so aristocratic-looking as the charming face. Her\\n\\ndress was of superb black velvet, ermine-trimmed, with diamonds thrown\\n\\nall abroad over it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot far from her stood the least little man I had ever seen; of such\\n\\nadmirable proportions no one could call him a dwarf, because with\\n\\nthat word we usually associate something of deformity; but yet with an\\n\\nelfin look of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that marred the\\n\\nimpression which his delicate regular little features would otherwise\\n\\nhave conveyed. Indeed, I do not think he was quite of equal rank with\\n\\nthe rest of the company, for his dress was inappropriate to the occasion\\n\\n(and he apparently was an invited, while I was an involuntary guest);\\n\\nand one or two of his gestures and actions were more like the tricks of\\n\\nan uneducated rustic than anything else. To explain what I mean: his\\n\\nboots had evidently seen much service, and had been re-topped, re-heeled,\\n\\nre-soled to the extent of cobbler\\'s powers. Why should he have come in\\n\\nthem if they were not his best--his only pair? And what can be more\\n\\nungenteel than poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of putting his\\n\\nhand up to his throat, as if he expected to find something the matter\\n\\nwith it; and he had the awkward habit--which I do not think he could\\n\\nhave copied from Dr. Johnson, because most probably he had never heard\\n\\nof him--of trying always to retrace his steps on the exact boards on\\n\\nwhich he had trodden to arrive at any particular part of the room.\\n\\nBesides, to settle the question, I once heard him addressed as Monsieur\\n\\nPoucet, without any aristocratic \"de\" for a prefix; and nearly every one\\n\\nelse in the room was a marquis, at any rate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI say, \"nearly every one;\" for some strange people had the entre;\\n\\nunless, indeed, they were, like me, benighted. One of the guests I\\n\\nshould have taken for a servant, but for the extraordinary influence he\\n\\nseemed to have over the man I took for his master, and who never did\\n\\nanything without, apparently, being urged thereto by this follower. The\\n\\nmaster, magnificently dressed, but ill at ease in his clothes, as if\\n\\nthey had been made for some one else, was a weak-looking, handsome\\n\\nman, continually sauntering about, and I almost guessed an object of\\n\\nsuspicion to some of the gentlemen present, which, perhaps, drove him on\\n\\nthe companionship of his follower, who was dressed something in the\\n\\nstyle of an ambassador\\'s chasseur; yet it was not a chasseur\\'s dress\\n\\nafter all; it was something more thoroughly old-world; boots half way up\\n\\nhis ridiculously small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if\\n\\nthey were too large for his little feet; and a great quantity of grey\\n\\nfur, as trimming to coat, court-mantle, boots, cap--everything. You know\\n\\nthe way in which certain countenances remind you perpetually of some\\n\\nanimal, be it bird or beast! Well, this chasseur (as I will call him\\n\\nfor want of a better name) was exceedingly like the great Tom-cat that\\n\\nyou have seen so often in my chambers, and laughed at almost as often\\n\\nfor his uncanny gravity of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my Tom--grey\\n\\nwhiskers had the chasseur: grey hair overshadows the upper lip of my\\n\\nTom--grey mustachios hid that of the chasseur. The pupils of Tom\\'s eyes\\n\\ndilate and contract as I had thought cats\\' pupils only could do, until\\n\\nI saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny as Tom is, the chasseur\\n\\nhad the advantage in the more intelligent expression. He seemed to have\\n\\nobtained most complete sway over his master or patron, whose looks he\\n\\nwatched, and whose steps he followed, with a kind of distrustful\\n\\ninterest that puzzled me greatly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were several other groups in the more distant part of the saloon,\\n\\nall of the stately old school, all grand and noble, I conjectured from\\n\\ntheir bearing. They seemed perfectly well acquainted with each other,\\n\\nas if they were in the habit of meeting. But I was interrupted in my\\n\\nobservations by the tiny little gentleman on the opposite side of the\\n\\nroom coming across to take a place beside me. It is no difficult matter\\n\\nto a Frenchman to slide into conversation, and so gracefully did my\\n\\npigmy friend keep up the character of the nation, that we were almost\\n\\nconfidential before ten minutes had elapsed.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I was quite aware that the welcome which all had extended to me,\\n\\nfrom the porter up to the vivacious lady and meek lord of the castle,\\n\\nwas intended for some other person. But it required either a degree\\n\\nof moral courage, of which I cannot boast, or the self-reliance and\\n\\nconversational powers of a bolder and cleverer man than I, to undeceive\\n\\npeople who had fallen into so fortunate a mistake for me. Yet the little\\n\\nman by my side insinuated himself so much into my confidence, that I had\\n\\nhalf a mind to tell him of my exact situation, and to turn him into a\\n\\nfriend and an ally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Madame is perceptibly growing older,\" said he, in the midst of my\\n\\nperplexity, glancing at our hostess.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Madame is still a very fine woman,\" replied I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, is it not strange,\" continued he, lowering his voice, \"how women\\n\\nalmost invariably praise the absent, or departed, as if they were angels\\n\\nof light, while as for the present, or the living\"--here he shrugged up\\n\\nhis little shoulders, and made an expressive pause. \"Would you believe\\n\\nit! Madame is always praising her late husband to monsieur\\'s face; till,\\n\\nin fact, we guests are quite perplexed how to look: for, you know, the\\n\\nlate M. de Retz\\'s character was quite notorious,--everybody has heard of\\n\\nhim.\" All the world of Touraine, thought I, but I made an assenting\\n\\nnoise.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and with a civil look\\n\\nof tender interest (such as some people put on when they inquire after\\n\\nyour mother, about whom they do not care one straw), asked if I had\\n\\nheard lately how my cat was? \"How my cat was!\" What could the man mean?\\n\\nMy cat! Could he mean the tailless Tom, born in the Isle of Man, and now\\n\\nsupposed to be keeping guard against the incursions of rats and mice\\n\\ninto my chambers in London? Tom is, as you know, on pretty good terms\\n\\nwith some of my friends, using their legs for rubbing-posts without\\n\\nscruple, and highly esteemed by them for his gravity of demeanour, and\\n\\nwise manner of winking his eyes. But could his fame have reached across\\n\\nthe Channel? However, an answer must be returned to the inquiry, as\\n\\nmonsieur\\'s face was bent down to mine with a look of polite anxiety; so\\n\\nI, in my turn, assumed an expression of gratitude, and assured him that,\\n\\nto the best of my belief, my cat was in remarkably good health.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And the climate agrees with her?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perfectly,\" said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep solicitude in a\\n\\ntailless cat who had lost one foot and half an ear in some cruel trap.\\n\\nMy host smiled a sweet smile, and, addressing a few words to my little\\n\\nneighbour, passed on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How wearisome those aristocrats are!\" quoth my neighbour, with a slight\\n\\nsneer. \"Monsieur\\'s conversation rarely extends to more than two sentences\\n\\nto any one. By that time his faculties are exhausted, and he needs the\\n\\nrefreshment of silence. You and I, monsieur, are, at any rate, indebted\\n\\nto our own wits for our rise in the world!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHere again I was bewildered! As you know, I am rather proud of my\\n\\ndescent from families which, if not noble themselves, are allied to\\n\\nnobility,--and as to my \"rise in the world\"--if I had risen, it would\\n\\nhave been rather for balloon-like qualities than for mother-wit, to\\n\\nbeing unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my head or my pockets.\\n\\nHowever, it was my cue to agree: so I smiled again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"For my part,\" said he, \"if a man does not stick at trifles, if he knows\\n\\nhow to judiciously add to, or withhold facts, and is not sentimental in\\n\\nhis parade of humanity, he is sure to do well; sure to affix a _de_ or\\n\\n_von_ to his name, and end his days in comfort. There is an example of\\n\\nwhat I am saying\"--and he glanced furtively at the weak-looking master\\n\\nof the sharp, intelligent servant, whom I have called the chasseur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything but a miller\\'s son,\\n\\nif it had not been for the talents of his servant. Of course you know\\n\\nhis antecedents?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI was going to make some remarks on the changes in the order of the\\n\\npeerage since the days of Louis XVI.--going, in fact, to be very\\n\\nsensible and historical--when there was a slight commotion among\\n\\nthe people at the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint liveries\\n\\nmust have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose (for I never\\n\\nsaw them enter, though I sate right opposite to the doors), and were\\n\\nhanding about the slight beverages and slighter viands which are\\n\\nconsidered sufficient refreshments, but which looked rather meagre to\\n\\nmy hungry appetite. These footmen were standing solemnly opposite\\n\\nto a lady,--beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but--sound asleep in a\\n\\nmagnificent settee. A gentleman who showed so much irritation at her\\n\\nill-timed slumbers, that I think he must have been her husband, was\\n\\ntrying to awaken her with actions not far removed from shakings. All in\\n\\nvain; she was quite unconscious of his annoyance, or the smiles of the\\n\\ncompany, or the automatic solemnity of the waiting footman, or the\\n\\nperplexed anxiety of monsieur and madame.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his curiosity was quenched\\n\\nin contempt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks on that scene,\" said\\n\\nhe. \"In the first place, note the ridiculous position into which their\\n\\nsuperstitious reverence for rank and title puts all these people. Because\\n\\nmonsieur is a reigning prince over some minute principality, the exact\\n\\nsituation of which no one has as yet discovered, no one must venture to\\n\\ntake their glass of eau sucr till Madame la Princesse awakens; and,\\n\\njudging from past experience, those poor lacqueys may have to stand for\\n\\na century before that happens. Next--always speaking as a moralist, you\\n\\nwill observe--note how difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired\\n\\nin youth!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then the prince succeeded, by what means I did not see, in awaking\\n\\nthe beautiful sleeper. But at first she did not remember where she was,\\n\\nand looking up at her husband with loving eyes, she smiled and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is it you, my prince?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement of the spectators\\n\\nand his own consequent annoyance, to be reciprocally tender, and turned\\n\\naway with some little French expression, best rendered into English by\\n\\n\"Pooh, pooh, my dear!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I had had a glass of delicious wine of some unknown quality, my\\n\\ncourage was in rather better plight than before, and I told my cynical\\n\\nlittle neighbour--whom I must say I was beginning to dislike--that I had\\n\\nlost my way in the wood, and had arrived at the chteau quite by\\n\\nmistake.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe seemed mightily amused at my story; said that the same thing had\\n\\nhappened to himself more than once; and told me that I had better luck\\n\\nthan he had on one of these occasions, when, from his account, he must\\n\\nhave been in considerable danger of his life. He ended his story by\\n\\nmaking me admire his boots, which he said he still wore, patched though\\n\\nthey were, and all their excellent quality lost by patching, because\\n\\nthey were of such a first-rate make for long pedestrian excursions.\\n\\n\"Though, indeed,\" he wound up by saying, \"the new fashion of railroads\\n\\nwould seem to supersede the necessity for this description of boots.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I consulted him as to whether I ought to make myself known to my\\n\\nhost and hostess as a benighted traveller, instead of the guest whom\\n\\nthey had taken me for, he exclaimed, \"By no means! I hate such squeamish\\n\\nmorality.\" And he seemed much offended by my innocent question, as if it\\n\\nseemed by implication to condemn something in himself. He was offended\\n\\nand silent; and just at this moment I caught the sweet, attractive eyes\\n\\nof the lady opposite--that lady whom I named at first as being no longer\\n\\nin the bloom of youth, but as being somewhat infirm about the feet, which\\n\\nwere supported on a raised cushion before her. Her looks seemed to say,\\n\\n\"Come here, and let us have some conversation together;\" and, with a bow\\n\\nof silent excuse to my little companion, I went across to the lame old\\n\\nlady. She acknowledged my coming with the prettiest gesture of thanks\\n\\npossible; and, half apologetically, said, \"It is a little dull to be\\n\\nunable to move about on such evenings as this; but it is a just punishment\\n\\nto me for my early vanities. My poor feet, that were by nature so small,\\n\\nare now taking their revenge for my cruelty in forcing them into such\\n\\nlittle slippers.... Besides, monsieur,\" with a pleasant smile, \"I thought\\n\\nit was possible you might be weary of the malicious sayings of your\\n\\nlittle neighbour. He has not borne the best character in his youth, and\\n\\nsuch men are sure to be cynical in their old age.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who is he?\" asked I, with English abruptness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"His name is Poucet, and his father was, I believe, a wood-cutter, or\\n\\ncharcoal burner, or something of the sort. They do tell sad stories\\n\\nof connivance at murder, ingratitude, and obtaining money on false\\n\\npretences--but you will think me as bad as he if I go on with my\\n\\nslanders. Rather let us admire the lovely lady coming up towards us,\\n\\nwith the roses in her hand--I never see her without roses, they are so\\n\\nclosely connected with her past history, as you are doubtless aware. Ah,\\n\\nbeauty!\" said my companion to the lady drawing near to us, \"it is like\\n\\nyou to come to me, now that I can no longer go to you.\" Then turning to\\n\\nme, and gracefully drawing me into the conversation, she said, \"You must\\n\\nknow that, although we never met until we were both married, we have\\n\\nbeen almost like sisters ever since. There have been so many points\\n\\nof resemblance in our circumstances, and I think I may say in our\\n\\ncharacters. We had each two elder sisters--mine were but half-sisters,\\n\\nthough--who were not so kind to us as they might have been.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But have been sorry for it since,\" put in the other lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Since we have married princes,\" continued the same lady, with an arch\\n\\nsmile that had nothing of unkindness in it, \"for we both have married\\n\\nfar above our original stations in life; we are both unpunctual in our\\n\\nhabits, and, in consequence of this failing of ours, we have both had to\\n\\nsuffer mortification and pain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And both are charming,\" said a whisper close behind me. \"My lord the\\n\\nmarquis, say it--say, \\'And both are charming.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And both are charming,\" was spoken aloud by another voice. I turned,\\n\\nand saw the wily cat-like chasseur, prompting his master to make civil\\n\\nspeeches.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ladies bowed with that kind of haughty acknowledgment which shows\\n\\nthat compliments from such a source are distasteful. But our trio of\\n\\nconversation was broken up, and I was sorry for it. The marquis looked\\n\\nas if he had been stirred up to make that one speech, and hoped that he\\n\\nwould not be expected to say more; while behind him stood the chasseur,\\n\\nhalf impertinent and half servile in his ways and attitudes. The ladies,\\n\\nwho were real ladies, seemed to be sorry for the awkwardness of the\\n\\nmarquis, and addressed some trifling questions to him, adapting\\n\\nthemselves to the subjects on which he could have no trouble in answering.\\n\\nThe chasseur, meanwhile, was talking to himself in a growling tone of\\n\\nvoice. I had fallen a little into the background at this interruption in\\n\\na conversation which promised to be so pleasant, and I could not help\\n\\nhearing his words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Really, De Carabas grows more stupid every day. I have a great mind to\\n\\nthrow off his boots, and leave him to his fate. I was intended for a\\n\\ncourt, and to a court I will go, and make my own fortune as I have made\\n\\nhis. The emperor will appreciate my talents.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd such are the habits of the French, or such his forgetfulness of good\\n\\nmanners in his anger, that he spat right and left on the parquetted\\n\\nfloor.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then a very ugly, very pleasant-looking man, came towards the\\n\\ntwo ladies to whom I had lately been speaking, leading up to them a\\n\\ndelicate, fair woman, dressed all in the softest white, as if she were\\n\\n_voue au blanc_. I do not think there was a bit of colour about her.\\n\\nI thought I heard her making, as she came along, a little noise of\\n\\npleasure, not exactly like the singing of a tea-kettle, nor yet like the\\n\\ncooing of a dove, but reminding me of each sound.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Madame de Mioumiou was anxious to see you,\" said he, addressing the\\n\\nlady with the roses, \"so I have brought her across to give you a\\n\\npleasure!\" What an honest, good face! but oh! how ugly! And yet I liked\\n\\nhis ugliness better than most persons\\' beauty. There was a look of\\n\\npathetic acknowledgment of his ugliness, and a deprecation of your too\\n\\nhasty judgment, in his countenance that was positively winning. The\\n\\nsoft, white lady kept glancing at my neighbour the chasseur, as if they\\n\\nhad had some former acquaintance, which puzzled me very much, as they\\n\\nwere of such different rank. However, their nerves were evidently strung\\n\\nto the same tune, for at a sound behind the tapestry, which was more\\n\\nlike the scuttering of rats and mice than anything else, both Madame de\\n\\nMioumiou and the chasseur started with the most eager look of anxiety on\\n\\ntheir countenances, and by their restless movements--madame\\'s panting,\\n\\nand the fiery dilation of his eyes--one might see that commonplace\\n\\nsounds affected them both in a manner very different to the rest of the\\n\\ncompany. The ugly husband of the lovely lady with the roses now\\n\\naddressed himself to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are much disappointed,\" he said, \"in finding that monsieur is not\\n\\naccompanied by his countryman--le grand Jean d\\'Angleterre; I cannot\\n\\npronounce his name rightly\"--and he looked at me to help him out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Le grand Jean d\\'Angleterre!\" now who was le grand Jean d\\'Angleterre?\\n\\nJohn Bull? John Russell? John Bright?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Jean--Jean\"--continued the gentleman, seeing my embarrassment. \"Ah,\\n\\nthese terrible English names--\\'Jean de Ganquilleur!\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI was as wise as ever. And yet the name struck me as familiar, but\\n\\nslightly disguised. I repeated it to myself. It was mighty like John the\\n\\nGiant-killer, only his friends always call that worthy \"Jack.\" I said\\n\\nthe name aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, that is it!\" said he. \"But why has he not accompanied you to our\\n\\nlittle reunion to-night?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI had been rather puzzled once or twice before, but this serious question\\n\\nadded considerably to my perplexity. Jack the Giant-killer had once, it\\n\\nis true, been rather an intimate friend of mine, as far as (printer\\'s)\\n\\nink and paper can keep up a friendship, but I had not heard his name\\n\\nmentioned for years; and for aught I knew he lay enchanted with King\\n\\nArthur\\'s knights, who lie entranced until the blast of the trumpets of\\n\\nfour mighty kings shall call them to help at England\\'s need. But the\\n\\nquestion had been asked in serious earnest by that gentleman, whom I\\n\\nmore wished to think well of me than I did any other person in the room.\\n\\nSo I answered respectfully that it was long since I had heard anything\\n\\nof my countryman; but that I was sure it would have given him as much\\n\\npleasure as it was doing myself to have been present at such an agreeable\\n\\ngathering of friends. He bowed, and then the lame lady took up the word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To-night is the night when, of all the year, this great old forest\\n\\nsurrounding the castle is said to be haunted by the phantom of a little\\n\\npeasant girl who once lived hereabouts; the tradition is that she was\\n\\ndevoured by a wolf. In former days I have seen her on this night out\\n\\nof yonder window at the end of the gallery. Will you, ma belle, take\\n\\nmonsieur to see the view outside by the moonlight (you may possibly see\\n\\nthe phantom-child); and leave me to a little _tte--tte_ with your\\n\\nhusband?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a gentle movement the lady with the roses complied with the other\\'s\\n\\nrequest, and we went to a great window, looking down on the forest, in\\n\\nwhich I had lost my way. The tops of the far-spreading and leafy trees\\n\\nlay motionless beneath us in that pale, wan light, which shows objects\\n\\nalmost as distinct in form, though not in colour, as by day. We looked\\n\\ndown on the countless avenues, which seemed to converge from all quarters\\n\\nto the great old castle; and suddenly across one, quite near to us,\\n\\nthere passed the figure of a little girl, with the \"capuchon\" on, that\\n\\ntakes the place of a peasant girl\\'s bonnet in France. She had a basket\\n\\non one arm, and by her, on the side to which her head was turned, there\\n\\nwent a wolf. I could almost have said it was licking her hand, as if in\\n\\npenitent love, if either penitence or love had ever been a quality of\\n\\nwolves,--but though not of living, perhaps it may be of phantom wolves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There, we have seen her!\" exclaimed my beautiful companion. \"Though so\\n\\nlong dead, her simple story of household goodness and trustful simplicity\\n\\nstill lingers in the hearts of all who have ever heard of her; and the\\n\\ncountry-people about here say that seeing that phantom-child on this\\n\\nanniversary brings good luck for the year. Let us hope that we shall\\n\\nshare in the traditionary good fortune. Ah! here is Madame de Retz--she\\n\\nretains the name of her first husband, you know, as he was of higher\\n\\nrank than the present.\" We were joined by our hostess.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If monsieur is fond of the beauties of nature and art,\" said she,\\n\\nperceiving that I had been looking at the view from the great window,\\n\\n\"he will perhaps take pleasure in seeing the picture.\" Here she sighed,\\n\\nwith a little affectation of grief. \"You know the picture I allude to,\"\\n\\naddressing my companion, who bowed assent, and smiled a little\\n\\nmaliciously, as I followed the lead of madame.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went after her to the other end of the saloon, noting by the way with\\n\\nwhat keen curiosity she caught up what was passing either in word or\\n\\naction on each side of her. When we stood opposite to the end wall, I\\n\\nperceived a full-length picture of a handsome, peculiar-looking man,\\n\\nwith--in spite of his good looks--a very fierce and scowling expression.\\n\\nMy hostess clasped her hands together as her arms hung down in front,\\n\\nand sighed once more. Then, half in soliloquy, she said--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was the love of my youth; his stern yet manly character first\\n\\ntouched this heart of mine. When--when shall I cease to deplore his\\n\\nloss!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNot being acquainted with her enough to answer this question (if,\\n\\nindeed, it were not sufficiently answered by the fact of her second\\n\\nmarriage), I felt awkward; and, by way of saying something, I\\n\\nremarked,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The countenance strikes me as resembling something I have seen\\n\\nbefore--in an engraving from an historical picture, I think; only, it is\\n\\nthere the principal figure in a group: he is holding a lady by her hair,\\n\\nand threatening her with his scimitar, while two cavaliers are rushing\\n\\nup the stairs, apparently only just in time to save her life.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Alas, alas!\" said she, \"you too accurately describe a miserable passage\\n\\nin my life, which has often been represented in a false light. The best\\n\\nof husbands\"--here she sobbed, and became slightly inarticulate with her\\n\\ngrief--\"will sometimes be displeased. I was young and curious, he was\\n\\njustly angry with my disobedience--my brothers were too hasty--the\\n\\nconsequence is, I became a widow!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter due respect for her tears, I ventured to suggest some commonplace\\n\\nconsolation. She turned round sharply:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, monsieur: my only comfort is that I have never forgiven the brothers\\n\\nwho interfered so cruelly, in such an uncalled-for manner, between my\\n\\ndear husband and myself. To quote my friend Monsieur Sganarelle--\\'Ce\\n\\nsont petites choses qui sont de temps en temps necessaires dans l\\'amiti;\\n\\net cinq ou six coups d\\'pe entre gens qui s\\'aiment ne font que\\n\\nragaillardir l\\'affection.\\' You observe the colouring is not quite what\\n\\nit should be?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In this light the beard is of rather a peculiar tint,\" said I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes: the painter did not do it justice. It was most lovely, and gave\\n\\nhim such a distinguished air, quite different from the common herd.\\n\\nStay, I will show you the exact colour, if you will come near this\\n\\nflambeau!\" And going near the light, she took off a bracelet of hair,\\n\\nwith a magnificent clasp of pearls. It was peculiar, certainly. I did\\n\\nnot know what to say. \"His precious lovely beard!\" said she. \"And the\\n\\npearls go so well with the delicate blue!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHer husband, who had come up to us, and waited till her eye fell upon\\n\\nhim before venturing to speak, now said, \"It is strange Monsieur Ogre is\\n\\nnot yet arrived!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not at all strange,\" said she, tartly. \"He was always very stupid, and\\n\\nconstantly falls into mistakes, in which he comes worse off; and it is\\n\\nvery well he does, for he is a credulous and cowardly fellow. Not at all\\n\\nstrange! If you will\"--turning to her husband, so that I hardly heard\\n\\nher words, until I caught--\"Then everybody would have their rights, and\\n\\nwe should have no more trouble. Is it not, monsieur?\" addressing me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If I were in England, I should imagine madame was speaking of the\\n\\nreform bill, or the millennium,--but I am in ignorance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just as I spoke, the great folding-doors were thrown open wide, and\\n\\nevery one started to their feet to greet a little old lady, leaning on a\\n\\nthin black wand--and--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Madame la Femarraine,\" was announced by a chorus of sweet shrill\\n\\nvoices.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in a moment I was lying in the grass close by a hollow oak-tree,\\n\\nwith the slanting glory of the dawning day shining full in my face, and\\n\\nthousands of little birds and delicate insects piping and warbling out\\n\\ntheir welcome to the ruddy splendour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX WEEKS AT HEPPENHEIM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I left Oxford, I determined to spend some months in travel before\\n\\nsettling down in life. My father had left me a few thousands, the income\\n\\narising from which would be enough to provide for all the necessary\\n\\nrequirements of a lawyer\\'s education; such as lodgings in a quiet part\\n\\nof London, fees and payment to the distinguished barrister with whom I\\n\\nwas to read; but there would be small surplus left over for luxuries or\\n\\namusements; and as I was rather in debt on leaving college, since I had\\n\\nforestalled my income, and the expenses of my travelling would have to\\n\\nbe defrayed out of my capital, I determined that they should not exceed\\n\\nfifty pounds. As long as that sum would last me I would remain abroad;\\n\\nwhen it was spent my holiday should be over, and I would return and\\n\\nsettle down somewhere in the neighbourhood of Russell Square, in order\\n\\nto be near Mr. ----\\'s chambers in Lincoln\\'s-inn. I had to wait in London\\n\\nfor one day while my passport was being made out, and I went to examine\\n\\nthe streets in which I purposed to live; I had picked them out, from\\n\\nstudying a map, as desirable; and so they were, if judged entirely by\\n\\nmy reason; but their aspect was very depressing to one country-bred, and\\n\\njust fresh from the beautiful street-architecture of Oxford. The thought\\n\\nof living in such a monotonous gray district for years made me all the\\n\\nmore anxious to prolong my holiday by all the economy which could eke\\n\\nout my fifty pounds. I thought I could make it last for one hundred days\\n\\nat least. I was a good walker, and had no very luxurious tastes in the\\n\\nmatter of accommodation or food; I had as fair a knowledge of German and\\n\\nFrench as any untravelled Englishman can have; and I resolved to avoid\\n\\nexpensive hotels such as my own countrymen frequented.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have stated this much about myself to explain how I fell in with the\\n\\nlittle story that I am going to record, but with which I had not much\\n\\nto do,--my part in it being little more than that of a sympathizing\\n\\nspectator. I had been through France into Switzerland, where I had gone\\n\\nbeyond my strength in the way of walking, and I was on my way home, when\\n\\none evening I came to the village of Heppenheim, on the Berg-Strasse. I\\n\\nhad strolled about the dirty town of Worms all morning, and dined in a\\n\\nfilthy hotel; and after that I had crossed the Rhine, and walked through\\n\\nLorsch to Heppenheim. I was unnaturally tired and languid as I dragged\\n\\nmyself up the rough-paved and irregular village street to the inn\\n\\nrecommended to me. It was a large building, with a green court before\\n\\nit. A cross-looking but scrupulously clean hostess received me, and\\n\\nshowed me into a large room with a dinner-table in it, which, though it\\n\\nmight have accommodated thirty or forty guests, only stretched down half\\n\\nthe length of the eating-room. There were windows at each end of the\\n\\nroom; two looked to the front of the house, on which the evening shadows\\n\\nhad already fallen; the opposite two were partly doors, opening into a\\n\\nlarge garden full of trained fruit-trees and beds of vegetables, amongst\\n\\nwhich rose-bushes and other flowers seemed to grow by permission, not by\\n\\noriginal intention. There was a stove at each end of the room, which, I\\n\\nsuspect, had originally been divided into two. The door by which I had\\n\\nentered was exactly in the middle, and opposite to it was another,\\n\\nleading to a great bed-chamber, which my hostess showed me as my\\n\\nsleeping quarters for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the place had been much less clean and inviting, I should have\\n\\nremained there; I was almost surprised myself at my vis inerti; once\\n\\nseated in the last warm rays of the slanting sun by the garden window,\\n\\nI was disinclined to move, or even to speak. My hostess had taken my\\n\\norders as to my evening meal, and had left me. The sun went down, and I\\n\\ngrew shivery. The vast room looked cold and bare; the darkness brought\\n\\nout shadows that perplexed me, because I could not fully make out the\\n\\nobjects that produced them after dazzling my eyes by gazing out into the\\n\\ncrimson light.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome one came in; it was the maiden to prepare for my supper. She began\\n\\nto lay the cloth at one end of the large table. There was a smaller one\\n\\nclose by me. I mustered up my voice, which seemed a little as if it was\\n\\ngetting beyond my control, and called to her,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you let me have my supper here on this table?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe came near; the light fell on her while I was in shadow. She was a\\n\\ntall young woman, with a fine strong figure, a pleasant face, expressive\\n\\nof goodness and sense, and with a good deal of comeliness about it, too,\\n\\nalthough the fair complexion was bronzed and reddened by weather, so as\\n\\nto have lost much of its delicacy, and the features, as I had afterwards\\n\\nopportunity enough of observing, were anything but regular. She had white\\n\\nteeth, however, and well-opened blue eyes--grave-looking eyes which had\\n\\nshed tears for past sorrow--plenty of light-brown hair, rather elaborately\\n\\nplaited, and fastened up by two great silver pins. That was all--perhaps\\n\\nmore than all--I noticed that first night. She began to lay the cloth\\n\\nwhere I had directed. A shiver passed over me: she looked at me, and\\n\\nthen said,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The gentleman is cold: shall I light the stove?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething vexed me--I am not usually so impatient: it was the coming-on\\n\\nof serious illness--I did not like to be noticed so closely; I believed\\n\\nthat food would restore me, and I did not want to have my meal delayed,\\n\\nas I feared it might be by the lighting of the stove; and most of all I\\n\\nwas feverishly annoyed by movement. I answered sharply and abruptly,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; bring supper quickly; that is all I want.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHer quiet, sad eyes met mine for a moment; but I saw no change in their\\n\\nexpression, as if I had vexed her by my rudeness: her countenance did\\n\\nnot for an instant lose its look of patient sense, and that is pretty\\n\\nnearly all I can remember of Thekla that first evening at Heppenheim.\\n\\n\\n\\nI suppose I ate my supper, or tried to do so, at any rate; and I must\\n\\nhave gone to bed, for days after I became conscious of lying there,\\n\\nweak as a new-born babe, and with a sense of past pain in all my weary\\n\\nlimbs. As is the case in recovering from fever, one does not care to\\n\\nconnect facts, much less to reason upon them; so how I came to be lying\\n\\nin that strange bed, in that large, half-furnished room; in what house\\n\\nthat room was; in what town, in what country, I did not take the trouble\\n\\nto recal. It was of much more consequence to me then to discover what\\n\\nwas the well-known herb that gave the scent to the clean, coarse sheets\\n\\nin which I lay. Gradually I extended my observations, always confining\\n\\nmyself to the present. I must have been well cared-for by some one, and\\n\\nthat lately, too, for the window was shaded, so as to prevent the\\n\\nmorning sun from coming in upon the bed; there was the crackling of\\n\\nfresh wood in the great white china stove, which must have been newly\\n\\nreplenished within a short time.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy-and-by the door opened slowly. I cannot tell why, but my impulse was\\n\\nto shut my eyes as if I were still asleep. But I could see through my\\n\\napparently closed eyelids. In came, walking on tip-toe, with a slow care\\n\\nthat defeated its object, two men. The first was aged from thirty to\\n\\nforty, in the dress of a Black Forest peasant,--old-fashioned coat and\\n\\nknee-breeches of strong blue cloth, but of a thoroughly good quality; he\\n\\nwas followed by an older man, whose dress, of more pretension as to cut\\n\\nand colour (it was all black), was, nevertheless, as I had often the\\n\\nopportunity of observing afterwards, worn threadbare.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir first sentences, in whispered German, told me who they were: the\\n\\nlandlord of the inn where I was lying a helpless log, and the village\\n\\ndoctor who had been called in. The latter felt my pulse, and nodded his\\n\\nhead repeatedly in approbation. I had instinctively known that I was\\n\\ngetting better, and hardly cared for this confirmation; but it seemed\\n\\nto give the truest pleasure to the landlord, who shook the hand of the\\n\\ndoctor, in a pantomime expressive of as much thankfulness as if I had\\n\\nbeen his brother. Some low-spoken remarks were made, and then some\\n\\nquestion was asked, to which, apparently, my host was unable to reply.\\n\\nHe left the room, and in a minute or two returned, followed by Thekla,\\n\\nwho was questioned by the doctor, and replied with a quiet clearness,\\n\\nshowing how carefully the details of my illness had been observed by\\n\\nher. Then she left the room, and, as if every minute had served to\\n\\nrestore to my brain its power of combining facts, I was suddenly prompted\\n\\nto open my eyes, and ask in the best German I could muster what day of\\n\\nthe month it was; not that I clearly remembered the date of my arrival\\n\\nat Heppenheim, but I knew it was about the beginning of September.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain the doctor conveyed his sense of extreme satisfaction in a series\\n\\nof rapid pantomimic nods, and then replied in deliberate but tolerable\\n\\nEnglish, to my great surprise,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is the 29th of September, my dear sir. You must thank the dear God.\\n\\nYour fever has made its course of twenty-one days. Now patience and care\\n\\nmust be practised. The good host and his household will have the care;\\n\\nyou must have the patience. If you have relations in England, I will do\\n\\nmy endeavours to tell them the state of your health.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have no near relations,\" said I, beginning in my weakness to cry, as\\n\\nI remembered, as if it had been a dream, the days when I had father,\\n\\nmother, sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Chut, chut!\" said he; then, turning to the landlord, he told him in\\n\\nGerman to make Thekla bring me one of her good bouillons; after which\\n\\nI was to have certain medicines, and to sleep as undisturbedly as\\n\\npossible. For days, he went on, I should require constant watching and\\n\\ncareful feeding; every twenty minutes I was to have something, either\\n\\nwine or soup, in small quantities.\\n\\n\\n\\nA dim notion came into my hazy mind that my previous husbandry of my\\n\\nfifty pounds, by taking long walks and scanty diet, would prove in the\\n\\nend very bad economy; but I sank into dozing unconsciousness before I\\n\\ncould quite follow out my idea. I was roused by the touch of a spoon on\\n\\nmy lips; it was Thekla feeding me. Her sweet, grave face had something\\n\\napproaching to a mother\\'s look of tenderness upon it, as she gave me\\n\\nspoonful after spoonful with gentle patience and dainty care: and then I\\n\\nfell asleep once more. When next I wakened it was night; the stove was\\n\\nlighted, and the burning wood made a pleasant crackle, though I could\\n\\nonly see the outlines and edges of red flame through the crevices of\\n\\nthe small iron door. The uncurtained window on my left looked into the\\n\\npurple, solemn night. Turning a little, I saw Thekla sitting near a table,\\n\\nsewing diligently at some great white piece of household work. Every now\\n\\nand then she stopped to snuff the candle; sometimes she began to ply her\\n\\nneedle again immediately; but once or twice she let her busy hands lie\\n\\nidly in her lap, and looked into the darkness, and thought deeply for a\\n\\nmoment or two; these pauses always ended in a kind of sobbing sigh, the\\n\\nsound of which seemed to restore her to self-consciousness, and she took\\n\\nto her sewing even more diligently than before. Watching her had a sort\\n\\nof dreamy interest for me; this diligence of hers was a pleasant contrast\\n\\nto my repose; it seemed to enhance the flavour of my rest. I was too\\n\\nmuch of an animal just then to have my sympathy, or even my curiosity,\\n\\nstrongly excited by her look of sad remembrance, or by her sighs.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a while she gave a little start, looked at a watch lying by her\\n\\non the table, and came, shading the candle by her hand, softly to my\\n\\nbedside. When she saw my open eyes she went to a porringer placed at the\\n\\ntop of the stove, and fed me with soup. She did not speak while doing\\n\\nthis. I was half aware that she had done it many times since the doctor\\'s\\n\\nvisit, although this seemed to be the first time that I was fully awake.\\n\\nShe passed her arm under the pillow on which my head rested, and raised\\n\\nme a very little; her support was as firm as a man\\'s could have been.\\n\\nAgain back to her work, and I to my slumbers, without a word being\\n\\nexchanged.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was broad daylight when I wakened again; I could see the sunny\\n\\natmosphere of the garden outside stealing in through the nicks at the\\n\\nside of the shawl hung up to darken the room--a shawl which I was sure\\n\\nhad not been there when I had observed the window in the night. How\\n\\ngently my nurse must have moved about while doing her thoughtful act!\\n\\n\\n\\nMy breakfast was brought me by the hostess; she who had received me on\\n\\nmy first arrival at this hospitable inn. She meant to do everything\\n\\nkindly, I am sure; but a sick room was not her place; by a thousand\\n\\nlittle mal-adroitnesses she fidgeted me past bearing; her shoes\\n\\ncreaked, her dress rustled; she asked me questions about myself which\\n\\nit irritated me to answer; she congratulated me on being so much better,\\n\\nwhile I was faint for want of the food which she delayed giving me in\\n\\norder to talk. My host had more sense in him when he came in, although\\n\\nhis shoes creaked as well as hers. By this time I was somewhat revived,\\n\\nand could talk a little; besides, it seemed churlish to be longer\\n\\nwithout acknowledging so much kindness received.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am afraid I have been a great trouble,\" said I. \"I can only say that\\n\\nI am truly grateful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis good broad face reddened, and he moved a little uneasily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how I could have done otherwise than I----than we, did,\"\\n\\nreplied he, in the soft German of the district. \"We were all glad enough\\n\\nto do what we could; I don\\'t say it was a pleasure, because it is our\\n\\nbusiest time of year,--but then,\" said he, laughing a little awkwardly,\\n\\nas if he feared his expression might have been misunderstood, \"I don\\'t\\n\\nsuppose it has been a pleasure to you either, sir, to be laid up so far\\n\\nfrom home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, indeed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I may as well tell you now, sir, that we had to look over your papers\\n\\nand clothes. In the first place, when you were so ill I would fain have\\n\\nlet your kinsfolk know, if I could have found a clue; and besides, you\\n\\nneeded linen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am wearing a shirt of yours though,\" said I, touching my sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, sir!\" said he again, reddening a little. \"I told Thekla to take\\n\\nthe finest out of the chest; but I am afraid you find it coarser than\\n\\nyour own.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all answer I could only lay my weak hand on the great brown paw\\n\\nresting on the bed-side. He gave me a sudden squeeze in return that I\\n\\nthought would have crushed my bones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said he, misinterpreting the sudden look of\\n\\npain which I could not repress; \"but watching a man come out of the\\n\\nshadow of death into life makes one feel very friendly towards him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No old or true friend that I have had could have done more for me than\\n\\nyou, and your wife, and Thekla, and the good doctor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am a widower,\" said he, turning round the great wedding-ring that\\n\\ndecked his third finger. \"My sister keeps house for me, and takes care\\n\\nof the children,--that is to say, she does it with the help of Thekla,\\n\\nthe house-maiden. But I have other servants,\" he continued. \"I am well\\n\\nto do, the good God be thanked! I have land, and cattle, and vineyards.\\n\\nIt will soon be our vintage-time, and then you must go and see my\\n\\ngrapes as they come into the village. I have a \\'_chasse_,\\' too, in the\\n\\nOdenwald; perhaps one day you will be strong enough to go and shoot the\\n\\n\\'_chevreuil_\\' with me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis good, true heart was trying to make me feel like a welcome guest.\\n\\nSome time afterwards I learnt from the doctor that--my poor fifty pounds\\n\\nbeing nearly all expended--my host and he had been brought to believe in\\n\\nmy poverty, as the necessary examination of my clothes and papers showed\\n\\nso little evidence of wealth. But I myself have but little to do with\\n\\nmy story; I only name these things, and repeat these conversations, to\\n\\nshow what a true, kind, honest man my host was. By the way, I may as\\n\\nwell call him by his name henceforward, Fritz Mller. The doctor\\'s name,\\n\\nWiedermann.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was tired enough with this interview with Fritz Mller; but when Dr.\\n\\nWiedermann came he pronounced me to be much better; and through the\\n\\nday much the same course was pursued as on the previous one: being\\n\\nfed, lying still, and sleeping, were my passive and active occupations.\\n\\nIt was a hot, sunshiny day, and I craved for air. Fresh air does not\\n\\nenter into the pharmacopoeia of a German doctor; but somehow I obtained\\n\\nmy wish. During the morning hours the window through which the sun\\n\\nstreamed--the window looking on to the front court--was opened a little;\\n\\nand through it I heard the sounds of active life, which gave me pleasure\\n\\nand interest enough. The hen\\'s cackle, the cock\\'s exultant call when he\\n\\nhad found the treasure of a grain of corn,--the movements of a tethered\\n\\ndonkey, and the cooing and whirring of the pigeons which lighted on the\\n\\nwindow-sill, gave me just subjects enough for interest. Now and then\\n\\na cart or carriage drove up,--I could hear them ascending the rough\\n\\nvillage street long before they stopped at the \"Halbmond,\" the village\\n\\ninn. Then there came a sound of running and haste in the house; and\\n\\nThekla was always called for in sharp, imperative tones. I heard little\\n\\nchildren\\'s footsteps, too, from time to time; and once there must have\\n\\nbeen some childish accident or hurt, for a shrill, plaintive little\\n\\nvoice kept calling out, \"Thekla, Thekla, liebe Thekla.\" Yet, after the\\n\\nfirst early morning hours, when my hostess attended on my wants, it was\\n\\nalways Thekla who came to give me my food or my medicine; who redded\\n\\nup my room; who arranged the degree of light, shifting the temporary\\n\\ncurtain with the shifting sun; and always as quietly and deliberately\\n\\nas though her attendance upon me were her sole work. Once or twice my\\n\\nhostess came into the large eating-room (out of which my room opened),\\n\\nand called Thekla away from whatever was her occupation in my room at\\n\\nthe time, in a sharp, injured, imperative whisper. Once I remember it\\n\\nwas to say that sheets were wanted for some stranger\\'s bed, and to\\n\\nask where she, the speaker, could have put the keys, in a tone of\\n\\nirritation, as though Thekla were responsible for Frulein Mller\\'s\\n\\nown forgetfulness.\\n\\n\\n\\nNight came on; the sounds of daily life died away into silence; the\\n\\nchildren\\'s voices were no more heard; the poultry were all gone to\\n\\nroost; the beasts of burden to their stables; and travellers were\\n\\nhoused. Then Thekla came in softly and quietly, and took up her\\n\\nappointed place, after she had done all in her power for my comfort.\\n\\nI felt that I was in no state to be left all those weary hours which\\n\\nintervened between sunset and sunrise; but I did feel ashamed that this\\n\\nyoung woman, who had watched by me all the previous night, and for aught\\n\\nI knew, for many before, and had worked hard, been run off her legs, as\\n\\nEnglish servants would say, all day long, should come and take up her\\n\\ncare of me again; and it was with a feeling of relief that I saw her\\n\\nhead bend forwards, and finally rest on her arms, which had fallen on\\n\\nthe white piece of sewing spread before her on the table. She slept; and\\n\\nI slept. When I wakened dawn was stealing into the room, and making pale\\n\\nthe lamplight. Thekla was standing by the stove, where she had been\\n\\npreparing the bouillon I should require on wakening. But she did not\\n\\nnotice my half-open eyes, although her face was turned towards the bed.\\n\\nShe was reading a letter slowly, as if its words were familiar to her,\\n\\nyet as though she were trying afresh to extract some fuller or some\\n\\ndifferent meaning from their construction. She folded it up softly and\\n\\nslowly, and replaced it in her pocket with the quiet movement habitual\\n\\nto her. Then she looked before her, not at me, but at vacancy filled up\\n\\nby memories; and as the enchanter brought up the scenes and people\\n\\nwhich she saw, but I could not, her eyes filled with tears--tears that\\n\\ngathered almost imperceptibly to herself as it would seem--for when one\\n\\nlarge drop fell on her hands (held slightly together before her as she\\n\\nstood) she started a little, and brushed her eyes with the back of her\\n\\nhand, and then came towards the bed to see if I was awake. If I had not\\n\\nwitnessed her previous emotion, I could never have guessed that she had\\n\\nany hidden sorrow or pain from her manner; tranquil, self-restrained as\\n\\nusual. The thought of this letter haunted me, especially as more than\\n\\nonce I, wakeful or watchful during the ensuing nights, either saw it in\\n\\nher hands, or suspected that she had been recurring to it from noticing\\n\\nthe same sorrowful, dreamy look upon her face when she thought herself\\n\\nunobserved. Most likely every one has noticed how inconsistently out of\\n\\nproportion some ideas become when one is shut up in any place without\\n\\nchange of scene or thought. I really grew quite irritated about this\\n\\nletter. If I did not see it, I suspected it lay _perdu_ in her pocket.\\n\\nWhat was in it? Of course it was a love-letter; but if so, what was\\n\\ngoing wrong in the course of her love? I became like a spoilt child in\\n\\nmy recovery; every one whom I saw for the time being was thinking only of\\n\\nme, so it was perhaps no wonder that I became my sole object of thought;\\n\\nand at last the gratification of my curiosity about this letter seemed\\n\\nto me a duty that I owed to myself. As long as my fidgety inquisitiveness\\n\\nremained ungratified, I felt as if I could not get well. But to do\\n\\nmyself justice, it was more than inquisitiveness. Thekla had tended me\\n\\nwith the gentle, thoughtful care of a sister, in the midst of her busy\\n\\nlife. I could often hear the Frulein\\'s sharp voice outside blaming her\\n\\nfor something that had gone wrong; but I never heard much from Thekla in\\n\\nreply. Her name was called in various tones by different people, more\\n\\nfrequently than I could count, as if her services were in perpetual\\n\\nrequisition, yet I was never neglected, or even long uncared-for. The\\n\\ndoctor was kind and attentive; my host friendly and really generous; his\\n\\nsister subdued her acerbity of manner when in my room, but Thekla was\\n\\nthe one of all to whom I owed my comforts, if not my life. If I could do\\n\\nanything to smooth her path (and a little money goes a great way in\\n\\nthese primitive parts of Germany), how willingly would I give it? So one\\n\\nnight I began--she was no longer needed to watch by my bedside, but she\\n\\nwas arranging my room before leaving me for the night--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thekla,\" said I, \"you don\\'t belong to Heppenheim, do you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at me, and reddened a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have been so good to me that I cannot help wanting to know more\\n\\nabout you. I must needs feel interested in one who has been by my side\\n\\nthrough my illness as you have. Where do your friends live? Are your\\n\\nparents alive?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAll this time I was driving at the letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was born at Altenahr. My father is an innkeeper there. He owns the\\n\\n\\'Golden Stag.\\' My mother is dead, and he has married again, and has many\\n\\nchildren.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And your stepmother is unkind to you,\" said I, jumping to a conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who said so?\" asked she, with a shade of indignation in her tone. \"She\\n\\nis a right good woman, and makes my father a good wife.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then why are you here living so far from home?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the look came back to her face which I had seen upon it during the\\n\\nnight hours when I had watched her by stealth; a dimming of the grave\\n\\nfrankness of her eyes, a light quiver at the corners of her mouth. But\\n\\nall she said was, \"It was better.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSomehow, I persisted with the wilfulness of an invalid. I am half\\n\\nashamed of it now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But why better, Thekla? Was there----\" How should I put it? I stopped a\\n\\nlittle, and then rushed blindfold at my object: \"Has not that letter\\n\\nwhich you read so often something to do with your being here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe fixed me with her serious eyes till I believe I reddened far more\\n\\nthan she; and I hastened to pour out, incoherently enough, my conviction\\n\\nthat she had some secret care, and my desire to help her if she was in\\n\\nany trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You cannot help me,\" said she, a little softened by my explanation,\\n\\nthough some shade of resentment at having been thus surreptitiously\\n\\nwatched yet lingered in her manner. \"It is an old story; a sorrow gone\\n\\nby, past, at least it ought to be, only sometimes I am foolish\"--her\\n\\ntones were softening now--\"and it is punishment enough that you have\\n\\nseen my folly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you had a brother here, Thekla, you would let him give you his\\n\\nsympathy if he could not give you his help, and you would not blame\\n\\nyourself if you had shown him your sorrow, should you? I tell you again,\\n\\nlet me be as a brother to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the first place, sir\"--this \"sir\" was to mark the distinction\\n\\nbetween me and the imaginary brother--\"I should have been ashamed to\\n\\nhave shown even a brother my sorrow, which is also my reproach and my\\n\\ndisgrace.\" These were strong words; and I suppose my face showed that I\\n\\nattributed to them a still stronger meaning than they warranted; but\\n\\n_honi soit qui mal y pense_--for she went on dropping her eyes and\\n\\nspeaking hurriedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My shame and my reproach is this: I have loved a man who has not loved\\n\\nme\"--she grasped her hands together till the fingers made deep white\\n\\ndents in the rosy flesh--\"and I can\\'t make out whether he ever did, or\\n\\nwhether he did once and is changed now; if only he did once love me, I\\n\\ncould forgive myself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith hasty, trembling hands she began to rearrange the tisane and\\n\\nmedicines for the night on the little table at my bed-side. But, having\\n\\ngot thus far, I was determined to persevere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thekla,\" said I, \"tell me all about it, as you would to your mother, if\\n\\nshe were alive. There are often misunderstandings which, never set to\\n\\nrights, make the misery and desolation of a life-time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe did not speak at first. Then she pulled out the letter, and said, in\\n\\na quiet, hopeless tone of voice:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You can read German writing? Read that, and see if I have any reason\\n\\nfor misunderstanding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe letter was signed \"Franz Weber,\" and dated from some small town in\\n\\nSwitzerland--I forget what--about a month previous to the time when I\\n\\nread it. It began with acknowledging the receipt of some money which had\\n\\nevidently been requested by the writer, and for which the thanks were\\n\\nalmost fulsome; and then, by the quietest transition in the world, he\\n\\nwent on to consult her as to the desirability of his marrying some girl\\n\\nin the place from which he wrote, saying that this Anna Somebody was\\n\\nonly eighteen and very pretty, and her father a well-to-do shopkeeper,\\n\\nand adding, with coarse coxcombry, his belief that he was not indifferent\\n\\nto the maiden herself. He wound up by saying that, if this marriage did\\n\\ntake place, he should certainly repay the various sums of money which\\n\\nThekla had lent him at different times.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was some time in making out all this. Thekla held the candle for me to\\n\\nread it; held it patiently and steadily, not speaking a word till I had\\n\\nfolded up the letter again, and given it back to her. Then our eyes met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is no misunderstanding possible, is there, sir?\" asked she, with\\n\\na faint smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" I replied; \"but you are well rid of such a fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe shook her head a little. \"It shows his bad side, sir. We have all\\n\\nour bad sides. You must not judge him harshly; at least, I cannot. But\\n\\nthen we were brought up together.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"At Altenahr?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; his father kept the other inn, and our parents, instead of being\\n\\nrivals, were great friends. Franz is a little younger than I, and was a\\n\\ndelicate child. I had to take him to school, and I used to be so proud\\n\\nof it and of my charge. Then he grew strong, and was the handsomest lad\\n\\nin the village. Our fathers used to sit and smoke together, and talk of\\n\\nour marriage, and Franz must have heard as much as I. Whenever he was in\\n\\ntrouble, he would come to me for what advice I could give him; and he\\n\\ndanced twice as often with me as with any other girl at all the dances,\\n\\nand always brought his nosegay to me. Then his father wished him to\\n\\ntravel, and learn the ways at the great hotels on the Rhine before he\\n\\nsettled down in Altenahr. You know that is the custom in Germany, sir.\\n\\nThey go from town to town as journeymen, learning something fresh\\n\\neverywhere, they say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I knew that was done in trades,\" I replied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; and among inn-keepers, too,\" she said. \"Most of the waiters\\n\\nat the great hotels in Frankfort, and Heidelberg, and Mayence, and, I\\n\\ndaresay, at all the other places, are the sons of innkeepers in small\\n\\ntowns, who go out into the world to learn new ways, and perhaps to pick\\n\\nup a little English and French; otherwise, they say, they should never\\n\\nget on. Franz went off from Altenahr on his journeyings four years ago\\n\\nnext May-day; and before he went, he brought me back a ring from Bonn,\\n\\nwhere he bought his new clothes. I don\\'t wear it now; but I have got it\\n\\nupstairs, and it comforts me to see something that shows me it was not\\n\\nall my silly fancy. I suppose he fell among bad people, for he soon\\n\\nbegan to play for money,--and then he lost more than he could always\\n\\npay--and sometimes I could help him a little, for we wrote to each other\\n\\nfrom time to time, as we knew each other\\'s addresses; for the little\\n\\nones grew around my father\\'s hearth, and I thought that I, too, would go\\n\\nforth into the world and earn my own living, so that----well, I will\\n\\ntell the truth--I thought that by going into service, I could lay by\\n\\nenough for buying a handsome stock of household linen, and plenty of\\n\\npans and kettles against--against what will never come to pass now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do the German women buy the pots and kettles, as you call them, when\\n\\nthey are married?\" asked I, awkwardly, laying hold of a trivial question\\n\\nto conceal the indignant sympathy with her wrongs which I did not like\\n\\nto express.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; the bride furnishes all that is wanted in the kitchen, and all\\n\\nthe store of house-linen. If my mother had lived, it would have been\\n\\nlaid by for me, as she could have afforded to buy it, but my stepmother\\n\\nwill have hard enough work to provide for her own four little girls.\\n\\nHowever,\" she continued, brightening up, \"I can help her, for now I\\n\\nshall never marry; and my master here is just and liberal, and pays me\\n\\nsixty florins a year, which is high wages.\" (Sixty florins are about\\n\\nfive pounds sterling.) \"And now, good-night, sir. This cup to the left\\n\\nholds the tisane, that to the right the acorn-tea.\" She shaded the\\n\\ncandle, and was leaving the room. I raised myself on my elbow, and\\n\\ncalled her back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go on thinking about this man,\" said I. \"He was not good enough\\n\\nfor you. You are much better unmarried.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps so,\" she answered gravely. \"But you cannot do him justice; you\\n\\ndo not know him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes after, I heard her soft and cautious return; she had taken\\n\\nher shoes off, and came in her stockinged feet up to my bedside, shading\\n\\nthe light with her hand. When she saw that my eyes were open, she laid\\n\\ndown two letters on the table, close by my night-lamp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps, some time, sir, you would take the trouble to read these\\n\\nletters; you would then see how noble and clever Franz really is. It is\\n\\nI who ought to be blamed, not he.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNo more was said that night.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome time the next morning I read the letters. They were filled with\\n\\nvague, inflated, sentimental descriptions of his inner life and feelings;\\n\\nentirely egotistical, and intermixed with quotations from second-rate\\n\\nphilosophers and poets. There was, it must be said, nothing in them\\n\\noffensive to good principle or good feeling, however much they might be\\n\\nopposed to good taste. I was to go into the next room that afternoon for\\n\\nthe first time of leaving my sick chamber. All morning I lay and\\n\\nruminated. From time to time I thought of Thekla and Franz Weber. She\\n\\nwas the strong, good, helpful character, he the weak and vain; how\\n\\nstrange it seemed that she should have cared for one so dissimilar;\\n\\nand then I remembered the various happy marriages when to an outsider\\n\\nit seemed as if one was so inferior to the other that their union\\n\\nwould have appeared a subject for despair if it had been looked at\\n\\nprospectively. My host came in, in the midst of these meditations,\\n\\nbringing a great flowered dressing-gown, lined with flannel, and the\\n\\nembroidered smoking-cap which he evidently considered as belonging to\\n\\nthis Indian-looking robe. They had been his father\\'s, he told me; and\\n\\nas he helped me to dress, he went on with his communications on small\\n\\nfamily matters. His inn was flourishing; the numbers increased every\\n\\nyear of those who came to see the church at Heppenheim: the church which\\n\\nwas the pride of the place, but which I had never yet seen. It was built\\n\\nby the great Kaiser Karl. And there was the Castle of Starkenburg, too,\\n\\nwhich the Abbots of Lorsch had often defended, stalwart churchmen as\\n\\nthey were, against the temporal power of the emperors. And Melibocus was\\n\\nnot beyond a walk either. In fact, it was the work of one person to\\n\\nsuperintend the inn alone; but he had his farm and his vineyards beyond,\\n\\nwhich of themselves gave him enough to do. And his sister was oppressed\\n\\nwith the perpetual calls made upon her patience and her nerves in an\\n\\ninn; and would rather go back and live at Worms. And his children wanted\\n\\nso much looking after. By the time he had placed himself in a condition\\n\\nfor requiring my full sympathy, I had finished my slow toilette; and I\\n\\nhad to interrupt his confidences, and accept the help of his good strong\\n\\narm to lead me into the great eating-room, out of which my chamber opened.\\n\\nI had a dreamy recollection of the vast apartment. But how pleasantly it\\n\\nwas changed! There was the bare half of the room, it is true, looking as\\n\\nit had done on that first afternoon, sunless and cheerless, with the\\n\\nlong, unoccupied table, and the necessary chairs for the possible\\n\\nvisitors; but round the windows that opened on the garden a part of the\\n\\nroom was enclosed by the household clothes\\'-horses hung with great\\n\\npieces of the blue homespun cloth of which the dress of the Black Forest\\n\\npeasant is made. This shut-in space was warmed by the lighted stove, as\\n\\nwell as by the lowering rays of the October sun. There was a little\\n\\nround walnut table with some flowers upon it, and a great cushioned\\n\\narmchair placed so as to look out upon the garden and the hills beyond.\\n\\nI felt sure that this was all Thekla\\'s arrangement; I had rather wondered\\n\\nthat I had seen so little of her this day. She had come once or twice on\\n\\nnecessary errands into my room in the morning, but had appeared to be in\\n\\ngreat haste, and had avoided meeting my eye. Even when I had returned\\n\\nthe letters, which she had entrusted to me with so evident a purpose of\\n\\nplacing the writer in my good opinion, she had never inquired as to how\\n\\nfar they had answered her design; she had merely taken them with some\\n\\nlow word of thanks, and put them hurriedly into her pocket. I suppose\\n\\nshe shrank from remembering how fully she had given me her confidence\\n\\nthe night before, now that daylight and actual life pressed close around\\n\\nher. Besides, there surely never was anyone in such constant request as\\n\\nThekla. I did not like this estrangement, though it was the natural\\n\\nconsequence of my improved health, which would daily make me less and\\n\\nless require services which seemed so urgently claimed by others. And,\\n\\nmoreover, after my host left me--I fear I had cut him a little short\\n\\nin the recapitulation of his domestic difficulties, but he was too\\n\\nthorough and good-hearted a man to bear malice--I wanted to be amused or\\n\\ninterested. So I rang my little hand-bell, hoping that Thekla would\\n\\nanswer it, when I could have fallen into conversation with her, without\\n\\nspecifying any decided want. Instead of Thekla the Frulein came, and\\n\\nI had to invent a wish; for I could not act as a baby, and say that I\\n\\nwanted my nurse. However, the Frulein was better than no one, so I\\n\\nasked her if I could have some grapes, which had been provided for me on\\n\\nevery day but this, and which were especially grateful to my feverish\\n\\npalate. She was a good, kind woman, although, perhaps, her temper was\\n\\nnot the best in the world; and she expressed the sincerest regret as she\\n\\ntold me that there were no more in the house. Like an invalid I fretted\\n\\nat my wish not being granted, and spoke out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But Thekla told me the vintage was not till the fourteenth; and you\\n\\nhave a vineyard close beyond the garden on the slope of the hill out\\n\\nthere, have you not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; and grapes for the gathering. But perhaps the gentleman does not\\n\\nknow our laws. Until the vintage--(the day of beginning the vintage is\\n\\nfixed by the Grand Duke, and advertised in the public papers)--until\\n\\nthe vintage, all owners of vineyards may only go on two appointed days\\n\\nin every week to gather their grapes; on those two days (Tuesdays and\\n\\nFridays this year) they must gather enough for the wants of their\\n\\nfamilies; and if they do not reckon rightly, and gather short measure,\\n\\nwhy they have to go without. And these two last days the Half-Moon has\\n\\nbeen besieged with visitors, all of whom have asked for grapes. But\\n\\nto-morrow the gentleman can have as many as he will; it is the day for\\n\\ngathering them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a strange kind of paternal law,\" I grumbled out. \"Why is it so\\n\\nordained? Is it to secure the owners against pilfering from their\\n\\nunfenced vineyards?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am sure I cannot tell,\" she replied. \"Country people in these\\n\\nvillages have strange customs in many ways, as I daresay the English\\n\\ngentleman has perceived. If he would come to Worms he would see a\\n\\ndifferent kind of life.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But not a view like this,\" I replied, caught by a sudden change of\\n\\nlight--some cloud passing away from the sun, or something. Right outside\\n\\nof the windows was, as I have so often said, the garden. Trained\\n\\nplum-trees with golden leaves, great bushes of purple, Michaelmas daisy,\\n\\nlate flowering roses, apple-trees partly stripped of their rosy fruit,\\n\\nbut still with enough left on their boughs to require the props set to\\n\\nsupport the luxuriant burden; to the left an arbour covered over with\\n\\nhoneysuckle and other sweet-smelling creepers--all bounded by a low gray\\n\\nstone wall which opened out upon the steep vineyard, that stretched up\\n\\nthe hill beyond, one hill of a series rising higher and higher into the\\n\\npurple distance. \"Why is there a rope with a bunch of straw tied in it\\n\\nstretched across the opening of the garden into the vineyard?\" I\\n\\ninquired, as my eye suddenly caught upon the object.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is the country way of showing that no one must pass along that path.\\n\\nTo-morrow the gentleman will see it removed; and then he shall have the\\n\\ngrapes. Now I will go and prepare his coffee.\" With a curtsey, after\\n\\nthe fashion of Worms gentility, she withdrew. But an under-servant\\n\\nbrought me my coffee; and with her I could not exchange a word: she\\n\\nspoke in such an execrable patois. I went to bed early, weary, and\\n\\ndepressed. I must have fallen asleep immediately, for I never heard any\\n\\none come to arrange my bed-side table; yet in the morning I found that\\n\\nevery usual want or wish of mine had been attended to.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was wakened by a tap at my door, and a pretty piping child\\'s voice\\n\\nasking, in broken German, to come in. On giving the usual permission,\\n\\nThekla entered, carrying a great lovely boy of two years old, or\\n\\nthereabouts, who had only his little night-shirt on, and was all flushed\\n\\nwith sleep. He held tight in his hands a great cluster of muscatel and\\n\\nnoble grapes. He seemed like a little Bacchus, as she carried him\\n\\ntowards me with an expression of pretty loving pride upon her face as\\n\\nshe looked at him. But when he came close to me--the grim, wasted,\\n\\nunshorn--he turned quick away, and hid his face in her neck, still\\n\\ngrasping tight his bunch of grapes. She spoke to him rapidly and softly,\\n\\ncoaxing him as I could tell full well, although I could not follow her\\n\\nwords; and in a minute or two the little fellow obeyed her, and turned\\n\\nand stretched himself almost to overbalancing out of her arms, and\\n\\nhalf-dropped the fruit on the bed by me. Then he clutched at her again,\\n\\nburying his face in her kerchief, and fastening his little fists in her\\n\\nluxuriant hair.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration p. 129: He seemed like a little Bacchus.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is my master\\'s only boy,\" said she, disentangling his fingers with\\n\\nquiet patience, only to have them grasp her braids afresh. \"He is my\\n\\nlittle Max, my heart\\'s delight, only he must not pull so hard. Say his\\n\\n\\'to-meet-again,\\' and kiss his hand lovingly, and we will go.\" The\\n\\npromise of a speedy departure from my dusky room proved irresistible;\\n\\nhe babbled out his Aufwiedersehen, and kissing his chubby hand, he was\\n\\nborne away joyful and chattering fast in his infantile half-language. I\\n\\ndid not see Thekla again until late afternoon, when she brought me in\\n\\nmy coffee. She was not like the same creature as the blooming, cheerful\\n\\nmaiden whom I had seen in the morning; she looked wan and careworn,\\n\\nolder by several years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is the matter, Thekla?\" said I, with true anxiety as to what might\\n\\nhave befallen my good, faithful nurse.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked round before answering. \"I have seen him,\" she said. \"He has\\n\\nbeen here, and the Frulein has been so angry! She says she will tell my\\n\\nmaster. Oh, it has been such a day!\" The poor young woman, who was\\n\\nusually so composed and self-restrained, was on the point of bursting\\n\\ninto tears; but by a strong effort she checked herself, and tried to\\n\\nbusy herself with rearranging the white china cup, so as to place it\\n\\nmore conveniently to my hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come, Thekla,\" said I, \"tell me all about it. I have heard loud voices\\n\\ntalking, and I fancied something had put the Frulein out; and Lottchen\\n\\nlooked flurried when she brought me my dinner. Is Franz here? How has he\\n\\nfound you out?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is here. Yes, I am sure it is he; but four years makes such a\\n\\ndifference in a man; his whole look and manner seemed so strange to me;\\n\\nbut he knew me at once, and called me all the old names which we used to\\n\\ncall each other when we were children; and he must needs tell me how it\\n\\nhad come to pass that he had not married that Swiss Anna. He said he had\\n\\nnever loved her; and that now he was going home to settle, and he hoped\\n\\nthat I would come too, and----\" There she stopped short.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And marry him, and live at the inn at Altenahr,\" said I, smiling, to\\n\\nreassure her, though I felt rather disappointed about the whole affair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" she replied. \"Old Weber, his father, is dead; he died in debt, and\\n\\nFranz will have no money. And he was always one that needed money. Some\\n\\nare, you know; and while I was thinking, and he was standing near me,\\n\\nthe Frulein came in; and--and--I don\\'t wonder--for poor Franz is not\\n\\na pleasant-looking man now-a-days--she was very angry, and called me\\n\\na bold, bad girl, and said she could have no such goings on at the\\n\\n\\'Halbmond,\\' but would tell my master when he came home from the forest.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you could have told her that you were old friends.\" I hesitated,\\n\\nbefore saying the word lovers, but, after a pause, out it came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Franz might have said so,\" she replied, a little stiffly. \"I could not;\\n\\nbut he went off as soon as she bade him. He went to the \\'Adler\\' over the\\n\\nway, only saying he would come for my answer to-morrow morning. I think\\n\\nit was he that should have told her what we were--neighbours\\' children\\n\\nand early friends--not have left it all to me. Oh,\" said she, clasping\\n\\nher hands tight together, \"she will make such a story of it to my\\n\\nmaster.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said I, \"tell the master I want to see him, as soon as he\\n\\ncomes in from the forest, and trust me to set him right before the\\n\\nFrulein has the chance to set him wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked up at me gratefully, and went away without any more words.\\n\\nPresently the fine burly figure of my host stood at the opening to my\\n\\nenclosed sitting-room. He was there, three-cornered hat in hand, looking\\n\\ntired and heated as a man does after a hard day\\'s work, but as kindly\\n\\nand genial as ever, which is not what every man is who is called to\\n\\nbusiness after such a day, before he has had the necessary food and\\n\\nrest.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had been reflecting a good deal on Thekla\\'s story; I could not quite\\n\\ninterpret her manner to-day to my full satisfaction; but yet the love\\n\\nwhich had grown with her growth, must assuredly have been called forth\\n\\nby her lover\\'s sudden reappearance; and I was inclined to give him some\\n\\ncredit for having broken off an engagement to Swiss Anna, which had\\n\\npromised so many worldly advantages; and, again, I had considered that\\n\\nif he was a little weak and sentimental, it was Thekla, who would marry\\n\\nhim by her own free will, and perhaps she had sense and quiet resolution\\n\\nenough for both. So I gave the heads of the little history I have\\n\\ntold you to my good friend and host, adding that I should like to\\n\\nhave a man\\'s opinion of this man; but that if he were not an absolute\\n\\ngood-for-nothing, and if Thekla still loved him, as I believed, I would\\n\\ntry and advance them the requisite money towards establishing themselves\\n\\nin the hereditary inn at Altenahr.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch was the romantic ending to Thekla\\'s sorrows, I had been planning\\n\\nand brooding over for the last hour. As I narrated my tale, and hinted\\n\\nat the possible happy conclusion that might be in store, my host\\'s\\n\\nface changed. The ruddy colour faded, and his look became almost\\n\\nstern--certainly very grave in expression. It was so unsympathetic, that\\n\\nI instinctively cut my words short. When I had done, he paused a little,\\n\\nand then said: \"You would wish me to learn all I can respecting this\\n\\nstranger now at the \\'Adler,\\' and give you the impression I receive of\\n\\nthe fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" said I; \"I want to learn all I can about him for Thekla\\'s\\n\\nsake.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"For Thekla\\'s sake I will do it,\" he gravely repeated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And come to me to-night, even if I am gone to bed?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not so,\" he replied. \"You must give me all the time you can in a matter\\n\\nlike this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But he will come for Thekla\\'s answer in the morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Before he comes you shall know all I can learn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI was resting during the fatigues of dressing the next day, when my host\\n\\ntapped at my door. He looked graver and sterner than I had ever seen him\\n\\ndo before; he sat down almost before I had begged him to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is not worthy of her,\" he said. \"He drinks brandy right hard; he\\n\\nboasts of his success at play, and\"--here he set his teeth hard--\"he\\n\\nboasts of the women who have loved him. In a village like this, sir,\\n\\nthere are always those who spend their evenings in the gardens of the\\n\\ninns; and this man, after he had drank his fill, made no secrets; it\\n\\nneeded no spying to find out what he was, else I should not have been\\n\\nthe one to do it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thekla must be told of this,\" said I. \"She is not the woman to love any\\n\\none whom she cannot respect.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHerr Mller laughed a low bitter laugh, quite unlike himself. Then he\\n\\nreplied,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As for that matter, sir, you are young; you have had no great experience\\n\\nof women. From what my sister tells me there can be little doubt of\\n\\nThekla\\'s feeling towards him. She found them standing together by the\\n\\nwindow; his arm round Thekla\\'s waist, and whispering in her ear--and to\\n\\ndo the maiden justice she is not the one to suffer such familiarities\\n\\nfrom every one. No\"--continued he, still in the same contemptuous\\n\\ntone--\"you\\'ll find she will make excuses for his faults and vices; or\\n\\nelse, which is perhaps more likely, she will not believe your story,\\n\\nthough I who tell it you can vouch for the truth of every word I say.\"\\n\\nHe turned short away and left the room. Presently I saw his stalwart\\n\\nfigure in the hill-side vineyard, before my windows, scaling the steep\\n\\nascent with long regular steps, going to the forest beyond. I was\\n\\notherwise occupied than in watching his progress during the next hour;\\n\\nat the end of that time he re-entered my room, looking heated and\\n\\nslightly tired, as if he had been walking fast, or labouring hard; but\\n\\nwith the cloud off his brows, and the kindly light shining once again\\n\\nout of his honest eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I ask your pardon, sir,\" he began, \"for troubling you afresh. I believe\\n\\nI was possessed by the devil this morning. I have been thinking it over.\\n\\nOne has perhaps no right to rule for another person\\'s happiness. To have\\n\\nsuch a\"--here the honest fellow choked a little--\"such a woman as Thekla\\n\\nto love him ought to raise any man. Besides, I am no judge for him or\\n\\nfor her. I have found out this morning that I love her myself, and so the\\n\\nend of it is, that if you, sir, who are so kind as to interest yourself\\n\\nin the matter, and if you think it is really her heart\\'s desire to marry\\n\\nthis man--which ought to be his salvation both for earth and heaven--I\\n\\nshall be very glad to go halves with you in any place for setting them\\n\\nup in the inn at Altenahr; only allow me to see that whatever money we\\n\\nadvance is well and legally tied up, so that it is secured to her. And\\n\\nbe so kind as to take no notice of what I have said about my having\\n\\nfound out that I have loved her; I named it as a kind of apology for my\\n\\nhard words this morning, and as a reason why I was not a fit judge of\\n\\nwhat was best.\" He had hurried on, so that I could not have stopped his\\n\\neager speaking even had I wished to do so; but I was too much interested\\n\\nin the revelation of what was passing in his brave tender heart to\\n\\ndesire to stop him. Now, however, his rapid words tripped each other up,\\n\\nand his speech ended in an unconscious sigh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But,\" I said, \"since you were here Thekla has come to me, and we have\\n\\nhad a long talk. She speaks now as openly to me as she would if I were\\n\\nher brother; with sensible frankness, where frankness is wise, with\\n\\nmodest reticence, where confidence would be unbecoming. She came to\\n\\nask me, if I thought it her duty to marry this fellow, whose very\\n\\nappearance, changed for the worse, as she says it is, since she last\\n\\nsaw him four years ago, seemed to have repelled her.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She could let him put his arm round her waist yesterday,\" said Herr\\n\\nMller, with a return of his morning\\'s surliness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And she would marry him now if she could believe it to be her duty.\\n\\nFor some reason of his own, this Franz Weber has tried to work upon this\\n\\nfeeling of hers. He says it would be the saving of him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As if a man had not strength enough in him--a man who is good for\\n\\naught--to save himself, but needed a woman to pull him through life!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" I replied, hardly able to keep from smiling. \"You yourself said,\\n\\nnot five minutes ago, that her marrying him might be his salvation both\\n\\nfor earth and heaven.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That was when I thought she loved the fellow,\" he answered quick.\\n\\n\"Now----but what did you say to her, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I told her, what I believe to be as true as gospel, that as she owned\\n\\nshe did not love him any longer now his real self had come to displace\\n\\nhis remembrance, that she would be sinning in marrying him; doing evil\\n\\nthat possible good might come. I was clear myself on this point, though\\n\\nI should have been perplexed how to advise, if her love had still\\n\\ncontinued.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And what answer did she make?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She went over the history of their lives; she was pleading against her\\n\\nwishes to satisfy her conscience. She said that all along through their\\n\\nchildhood she had been his strength; that while under her personal\\n\\ninfluence he had been negatively good; away from her, he had fallen into\\n\\nmischief--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not to say vice,\" put in Herr Mller.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And now he came to her penitent, in sorrow, desirous of amendment,\\n\\nasking her for the love she seems to have considered as tacitly plighted\\n\\nto him in years gone by--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And which he has slighted and insulted. I hope you told her of his\\n\\nwords and conduct last night in the \\'Adler\\' gardens?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. I kept myself to the general principle, which, I am sure, is a\\n\\ntrue one. I repeated it in different forms; for the idea of the duty\\n\\nof self-sacrifice had taken strong possession of her fancy. Perhaps,\\n\\nif I had failed in setting her notion of her duty in the right aspect,\\n\\nI might have had recourse to the statement of facts, which would have\\n\\npained her severely, but would have proved to her how little his words\\n\\nof penitence and promises of amendment were to be trusted to.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And it ended?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ended by her being quite convinced that she would be doing wrong\\n\\ninstead of right if she married a man whom she had entirely ceased to\\n\\nlove, and that no real good could come from a course of action based on\\n\\nwrong-doing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is right and true,\" he replied, his face broadening into happiness\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But she says she must leave your service, and go elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Leave my service she shall; go elsewhere she shall not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot tell what you may have the power of inducing her to do; but\\n\\nshe seems to me very resolute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why?\" said he, firing round at me, as if I had made her resolute.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She says your sister spoke to her before the maids of the household,\\n\\nand before some of the townspeople, in a way that she could not stand;\\n\\nand that you yourself by your manner to her last night showed how she\\n\\nhad lost your respect. She added, with her face of pure maidenly truth,\\n\\nthat he had come into such close contact with her only the instant\\n\\nbefore your sister had entered the room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With your leave, sir,\" said Herr Mller, turning towards the door, \"I\\n\\nwill go and set all that right at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easier said than done. When I next saw Thekla, her eyes were\\n\\nswollen up with crying, but she was silent, almost defiant towards\\n\\nme. A look of resolute determination had settled down upon her face. I\\n\\nlearnt afterwards that parts of my conversation with Herr Mller had been\\n\\ninjudiciously quoted by him in the talk he had had with her. I thought I\\n\\nwould leave her to herself, and wait till she unburdened herself of the\\n\\nfeeling of unjust resentment towards me. But it was days before she\\n\\nspoke to me with anything like her former frankness. I had heard all\\n\\nabout it from my host long before.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had gone to her straight on leaving me; and like a foolish, impetuous\\n\\nlover, had spoken out his mind and his wishes to her in the presence of\\n\\nhis sister, who, it must be remembered, had heard no explanation of the\\n\\nconduct which had given her propriety so great a shock the day before.\\n\\nHerr Mller thought to re-instate Thekla in his sister\\'s good opinion by\\n\\ngiving her in the Frulein\\'s very presence the highest possible mark of\\n\\nhis own love and esteem. And there in the kitchen, where the Frulein\\n\\nwas deeply engaged in the hot work of making some delicate preserve\\n\\non the stove, and ordering Thekla about with short, sharp displeasure\\n\\nin her tones, the master had come in, and possessing himself of the\\n\\nmaiden\\'s hand, had, to her infinite surprise--to his sister\\'s infinite\\n\\nindignation--made her the offer of his heart, his wealth, his life; had\\n\\nbegged of her to marry him. I could gather from his account that she had\\n\\nbeen in a state of trembling discomfiture at first; she had not spoken,\\n\\nbut had twisted her hand out of his, and had covered her face with her\\n\\napron. And then the Frulein had burst forth--\"accursed words\" he called\\n\\nher speech. Thekla uncovered her face to listen; to listen to the end;\\n\\nto listen to the passionate recrimination between the brother and the\\n\\nsister. And then she went up, close up to the angry Frulein, and had\\n\\nsaid quite quietly, but with a manner of final determination which had\\n\\nevidently sunk deep into her suitor\\'s heart, and depressed him into\\n\\nhopelessness, that the Frulein had no need to disturb herself; that on\\n\\nthis very day she had been thinking of marrying another man, and that\\n\\nher heart was not like a room to let, into which as one tenant went out\\n\\nanother might enter. Nevertheless, she felt the master\\'s goodness. He\\n\\nhad always treated her well from the time when she had entered the house\\n\\nas his servant. And she should be sorry to leave him; sorry to leave the\\n\\nchildren; very sorry to leave little Max: yes, she should even be sorry\\n\\nto leave the Frulein, who was a good woman, only a little too apt\\n\\nto be hard on other women. But she had already been that very day and\\n\\ndeposited her warning at the police office; the busy time would be soon\\n\\nover, and she should be glad to leave their service on All Saints\\' Day.\\n\\nThen (he thought) she had felt inclined to cry, for she suddenly braced\\n\\nherself up, and said, yes, she should be very glad; for somehow, though\\n\\nthey had been kind to her, she had been very unhappy at Heppenheim; and\\n\\nshe would go back to her home for a time, and see her old father and\\n\\nkind stepmother, and her nursling half-sister Ida, and be among her own\\n\\npeople again.\\n\\n\\n\\nI could see it was this last part that most of all rankled in Herr\\n\\nMller\\'s mind. In all probability Franz Weber was making his way back to\\n\\nHeppenheim too; and the bad suspicion would keep welling up that some\\n\\nlingering feeling for her old lover and disgraced playmate was making\\n\\nher so resolute to leave and return to Altenahr.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some days after this I was the confidant of the whole household,\\n\\nexcepting Thekla. She, poor creature, looked miserable enough; but the\\n\\nhardy, defiant expression was always on her face. Lottchen spoke out\\n\\nfreely enough; the place would not be worth having if Thekla left it; it\\n\\nwas she who had the head for everything, the patience for everything;\\n\\nwho stood between all the under-servants and the Frulein\\'s tempers. As\\n\\nfor the children, poor motherless children! Lottchen was sure that the\\n\\nmaster did not know what he was doing when he allowed his sister to turn\\n\\nThekla away--and all for what? for having a lover, as every girl had who\\n\\ncould get one. Why, the little boy Max slept in the room which Lottchen\\n\\nshared with Thekla; and she heard him in the night as quickly as if she\\n\\nwas his mother; when she had been sitting up with me, when I was so ill,\\n\\nLottchen had had to attend to him; and it was weary work after a hard\\n\\nday to have to get up and soothe a teething child; she knew she had been\\n\\ncross enough sometimes; but Thekla was always good and gentle with him,\\n\\nhowever tired he was. And as Lottchen left the room I could hear her\\n\\nrepeating that she thought she should leave when Thekla went, for that\\n\\nher place would not be worth having.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven the Frulein had her word of regret--regret mingled with\\n\\nself-justification. She thought she had been quite right in speaking to\\n\\nThekla for allowing such familiarities; how was she to know that the man\\n\\nwas an old friend and playmate? He looked like a right profligate\\n\\ngood-for-nothing. And to have a servant take up her scolding as an\\n\\nunpardonable offence, and persist in quitting her place, just when she\\n\\nhad learnt all her work, and was so useful in the household--so\\n\\nuseful that the Frulein could never put up with any fresh, stupid\\n\\nhouse-maiden, but, sooner than take the trouble of teaching the new\\n\\nservant where everything was, and how to give out the stores if she was\\n\\nbusy, she would go back to Worms. For, after all, housekeeping for a\\n\\nbrother was thankless work; there was no satisfying men; and Heppenheim\\n\\nwas but a poor ignorant village compared to Worms.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe must have spoken to her brother about her intention of leaving him,\\n\\nand returning to her former home; indeed a feeling of coolness had\\n\\nevidently grown up between the brother and sister during these latter\\n\\ndays. When one evening Herr Mller brought in his pipe, and, as his\\n\\ncustom had sometimes been, sat down by my stove to smoke, he looked\\n\\ngloomy and annoyed. I let him puff away, and take his own time. At\\n\\nlength he began,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have rid the village of him at last. I could not bear to have him\\n\\nhere disgracing Thekla with speaking to her whenever she went to the\\n\\nvineyard or the fountain. I don\\'t believe she likes him a bit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No more do I,\" I said. He turned on me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then why did she speak to him at all? Why cannot she like an honest man\\n\\nwho likes her? Why is she so bent on going home to Altenahr?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She speaks to him because she has known him from a child, and has a\\n\\nfaithful pity for one whom she has known so innocent, and who is now so\\n\\nlost in all good men\\'s regard. As for not liking an honest man--(though\\n\\nI may have my own opinion about that)--liking goes by fancy, as we say\\n\\nin English; and Altenahr is her home; her father\\'s house is at Altenahr,\\n\\nas you know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder if he will go there,\" quoth Herr Mller, after two or three\\n\\nmore puffs. \"He was fast at the \\'Adler;\\' he could not pay his score, so\\n\\nhe kept on staying here, saying that he should receive a letter from a\\n\\nfriend with money in a day or two; lying in wait, too, for Thekla, who\\n\\nis well-known and respected all through Heppenheim: so his being an old\\n\\nfriend of hers made him have a kind of standing. I went in this morning\\n\\nand paid his score, on condition that he left the place this day; and he\\n\\nleft the village as merrily as a cricket, caring no more for Thekla than\\n\\nfor the Kaiser who built our church: for he never looked back at the\\n\\n\\'Halbmond,\\' but went whistling down the road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is a good riddance,\" said I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. But my sister says she must return to Worms. And Lottchen has\\n\\ngiven notice; she says the place will not be worth having when Thekla\\n\\nleaves. I wish I could give notice too.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Try Thekla again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not I,\" said he, reddening. \"It would seem now as if I only wanted her\\n\\nfor a housekeeper. Besides, she avoids me at every turn, and will not\\n\\neven look at me. I am sure she bears me some ill-will about that\\n\\nne\\'er-do-well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was silence between us for some time, which he at length broke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The pastor has a good and comely daughter. Her mother is a famous\\n\\nhousewife. They often have asked me to come to the parsonage and smoke a\\n\\npipe. When the vintage is over, and I am less busy, I think I will go\\n\\nthere, and look about me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When is the vintage?\" asked I. \"I hope it will take place soon, for I\\n\\nam growing so well and strong I fear I must leave you shortly; but I\\n\\nshould like to see the vintage first.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, never fear! you must not travel yet awhile; and Government has\\n\\nfixed the grape-gathering to begin on the fourteenth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a paternal Government! How does it know when the grapes will be\\n\\nripe? Why cannot every man fix his own time for gathering his own\\n\\ngrapes?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That has never been our way in Germany. There are people employed by\\n\\nthe Government to examine the vines, and report when the grapes are\\n\\nripe. It is necessary to make laws about it; for, as you must have seen,\\n\\nthere is nothing but the fear of the law to protect our vineyards and\\n\\nfruit-trees; there are no enclosures along the Berg-Strasse, as you tell\\n\\nme you have in England; but, as people are only allowed to go into the\\n\\nvineyards on stated days, no one, under pretence of gathering his own\\n\\nproduce, can stray into his neighbour\\'s grounds and help himself,\\n\\nwithout some of the duke\\'s foresters seeing him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"to each country its own laws.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI think it was on that very evening that Thekla came in for something.\\n\\nShe stopped arranging the tablecloth and the flowers, as if she had\\n\\nsomething to say, yet did not know how to begin. At length I found that\\n\\nher sore, hot heart, wanted some sympathy; her hand was against every\\n\\none\\'s, and she fancied every one had turned against her. She looked up\\n\\nat me, and said, a little abruptly,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Does the gentleman know that I go on the fifteenth?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So soon?\" said I, with surprise. \"I thought you were to remain here\\n\\ntill All Saints\\' Day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So I should have done--so I must have done--if the Frulein had not\\n\\nkindly given me leave to accept of a place--a very good place too--of\\n\\nhousekeeper to a widow lady at Frankfort. It is just the sort of\\n\\nsituation I have always wished for. I expect I shall be so happy and\\n\\ncomfortable there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Methinks the lady doth profess too much,\" came into my mind. I saw she\\n\\nexpected me to doubt the probability of her happiness, and was in a\\n\\ndefiant mood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said I, \"you would hardly have wished to leave Heppenheim\\n\\nif you had been happy here; and every new place always promises fair,\\n\\nwhatever its performance may be. But wherever you go, remember you have\\n\\nalways a friend in me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"I think you are to be trusted. Though, from my\\n\\nexperience, I should say that of very few men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have been unfortunate,\" I answered; \"many men would say the same of\\n\\nwomen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe thought a moment, and then said, in a changed tone of voice, \"The\\n\\nFrulein here has been much more friendly and helpful of these late\\n\\ndays than her brother; yet I have served him faithfully, and have cared\\n\\nfor his little Max as though he were my own brother. But this morning he\\n\\nspoke to me for the first time for many days,--he met me in the passage,\\n\\nand, suddenly stopping, he said he was glad I had met with so comfortable\\n\\na place, and that I was at full liberty to go whenever I liked: and then\\n\\nhe went quickly on, never waiting for my answer.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And what was wrong in that? It seems to me he was trying to make you\\n\\nfeel entirely at your ease, to do as you thought best, without regard to\\n\\nhis own interests.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps so. It is silly, I know,\" she continued, turning full on me her\\n\\ngrave, innocent eyes; \"but one\\'s vanity suffers a little when every one\\n\\nis so willing to part with one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thekla! I owe you a great debt--let me speak to you openly. I know\\n\\nthat your master wanted to marry you, and that you refused him. Do not\\n\\ndeceive yourself. You are sorry for that refusal now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe kept her serious look fixed upon me; but her face and throat\\n\\nreddened all over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said she, at length; \"I am not sorry. What can you think I am\\n\\nmade of; having loved one man ever since I was a little child until a\\n\\nfortnight ago, and now just as ready to love another? I know you do not\\n\\nrightly consider what you say, or I should take it as an insult.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You loved an ideal man; he disappointed you, and you clung to your\\n\\nremembrance of him. He came, and the reality dispelled all illusions.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I do not understand philosophy,\" said she. \"I only know that I think\\n\\nthat Herr Mller had lost all respect for me from what his sister had\\n\\ntold him; and I know that I am going away; and I trust I shall be\\n\\nhappier in Frankfort than I have been here of late days.\" So saying, she\\n\\nleft the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was wakened up on the morning of the fourteenth by the merry ringing\\n\\nof church bells, and the perpetual firing and popping off of guns and\\n\\npistols. But all this was over by the time I was up and dressed, and\\n\\nseated at breakfast in my partitioned room. It was a perfect October\\n\\nday; the dew not yet off the blades of grass, glistening on the delicate\\n\\ngossamer webs, which stretched from flower to flower in the garden,\\n\\nlying in the morning shadow of the house. But beyond the garden, on\\n\\nthe sunny hill-side, men, women, and children were clambering up the\\n\\nvineyards like ants,--busy, irregular in movement, clustering together,\\n\\nspreading wide apart,--I could hear the shrill merry voices as I\\n\\nsat,--and all along the valley, as far as I could see, it was much the\\n\\nsame; for every one filled his house for the day of the vintage, that\\n\\ngreat annual festival. Lottchen, who had brought in my breakfast, was\\n\\nall in her Sunday best, having risen early to get her work done and go\\n\\nabroad to gather grapes. Bright colours seemed to abound; I could see\\n\\ndots of scarlet, and crimson, and orange through the fading leaves; it\\n\\nwas not a day to languish in the house; and I was on the point of going\\n\\nout by myself, when Herr Mller came in to offer me his sturdy arm, and\\n\\nhelp me in walking to the vineyard. We crept through the garden scented\\n\\nwith late flowers and sunny fruit,--we passed through the gate I had so\\n\\noften gazed at from the easy-chair, and were in the busy vineyard; great\\n\\nbaskets lay on the grass already piled nearly full of purple and yellow\\n\\ngrapes. The wine made from these was far from pleasant to my taste; for\\n\\nthe best Rhine wine is made from a smaller grape, growing in closer,\\n\\nharder clusters; but the larger and less profitable grape is by far the\\n\\nmost picturesque in its mode of growth, and far the best to eat into the\\n\\nbargain. Wherever we trod, it was on fragrant, crushed vine-leaves;\\n\\nevery one we saw had his hands and face stained with the purple juice.\\n\\nPresently I sat down on a sunny bit of grass, and my host left me to go\\n\\nfarther afield, to look after the more distant vineyards. I watched his\\n\\nprogress. After he left me, he took off coat and waistcoat, displaying\\n\\nhis snowy shirt and gaily-worked braces; and presently he was as busy\\n\\nas any one. I looked down on the village; the gray and orange and\\n\\ncrimson roofs lay glowing in the noonday sun. I could see down into the\\n\\nstreets; but they were all empty--even the old people came toiling up\\n\\nthe hill-side to share in the general festivity. Lottchen had brought up\\n\\ncold dinners for a regiment of men; every one came and helped himself.\\n\\nThekla was there, leading the little Karoline, and helping the toddling\\n\\nsteps of Max; but she kept aloof from me; for I knew, or suspected, or\\n\\nhad probed too much. She alone looked sad and grave, and spoke so\\n\\nlittle, even to her friends, that it was evident to see that she was\\n\\ntrying to wean herself finally from the place. But I could see that she\\n\\nhad lost her short, defiant manner. What she did say was kindly and\\n\\ngently spoken. The Frulein came out late in the morning, dressed, I\\n\\nsuppose, in the latest Worms fashion--quite different to anything I had\\n\\never seen before. She came up to me, and talked very graciously to me\\n\\nfor some time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here comes the proprietor (squire) and his lady, and their dear\\n\\nchildren. See, the vintagers have tied bunches of the finest grapes on\\n\\nto a stick, heavier than the children or even the lady can carry. Look!\\n\\nlook! how he bows!--one can tell he has been an _attach_ at Vienna.\\n\\nThat is the court way of bowing there--holding the hat right down before\\n\\nthem, and bending the back at right angles. How graceful! And here is\\n\\nthe doctor! I thought he would spare time to come up here. Well, doctor,\\n\\nyou will go all the more cheerfully to your next patient for having been\\n\\nup into the vineyards. Nonsense, about grapes making other patients for\\n\\nyou. Ah, here is the pastor and his wife, and the Frulein Anna. Now,\\n\\nwhere is my brother, I wonder? Up in the far vineyard, I make no doubt.\\n\\nMr. Pastor, the view up above is far finer than what it is here, and the\\n\\nbest grapes grow there; shall I accompany you and madame, and the dear\\n\\nFrulein? The gentleman will excuse me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI was left alone. Presently I thought I would walk a little farther,\\n\\nor at any rate change my position. I rounded a corner in the pathway,\\n\\nand there I found Thekla, watching by little sleeping Max. He lay on\\n\\nher shawl; and over his head she had made an arching canopy of broken\\n\\nvine-branches, so that the great leaves threw their cool, flickering\\n\\nshadows on his face. He was smeared all over with grape-juice, his\\n\\nsturdy fingers grasped a half-eaten bunch even in his sleep. Thekla was\\n\\nkeeping Lina quiet by teaching her how to weave a garland for her head\\n\\nout of field-flowers and autumn-tinted leaves. The maiden sat on the\\n\\nground, with her back to the valley beyond, the child kneeling by her,\\n\\nwatching the busy fingers with eager intentness. Both looked up as I\\n\\ndrew near, and we exchanged a few words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where is the master?\" I asked. \"I promised to await his return; he\\n\\nwished to give me his arm down the wooden steps; but I do not see him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is in the higher vineyard,\" said Thekla, quietly, but not looking\\n\\nround in that direction. \"He will be some time there, I should think.\\n\\nHe went with the pastor and his wife; he will have to speak to his\\n\\nlabourers and his friends. My arm is strong, and I can leave Max in\\n\\nLina\\'s care for five minutes. If you are tired, and want to go back, let\\n\\nme help you down the steps; they are steep and slippery.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI had turned to look up the valley. Three or four hundred yards off,\\n\\nin the higher vineyard, walked the dignified pastor, and his homely,\\n\\ndecorous wife. Behind came the Frulein Anna, in her short-sleeved\\n\\nSunday gown, daintily holding a parasol over her luxuriant brown\\n\\nhair. Close behind her came Herr Mller, stopping now to speak to his\\n\\nmen,--again, to cull out a bunch of grapes to tie on to the Frulein\\'s\\n\\nstick; and by my feet sate the proud serving-maid in her country dress,\\n\\nwaiting for my answer, with serious, up-turned eyes, and sad, composed\\n\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, Thekla; and if I did not feel so strong I\\n\\nwould have thankfully taken your arm. But I only wanted to leave a\\n\\nmessage for the master, just to say that I have gone home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Lina will give it to the father when he comes down,\" said Thekla.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went slowly down into the garden. The great labour of the day was\\n\\nover, and the younger part of the population had returned to the\\n\\nvillage, and were preparing the fireworks and pistol-shootings for the\\n\\nevening. Already one or two of those well-known German carts (in the\\n\\nshape of a V) were standing near the vineyard gates, the patient oxen\\n\\nmeekly waiting while basketful after basketful of grapes were being\\n\\nemptied into the leaf-lined receptacle.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I sat down in my easy-chair close to the open window through which I\\n\\nhad entered, I could see the men and women on the hill-side drawing to a\\n\\ncentre, and all stand round the pastor, bareheaded, for a minute or so.\\n\\nI guessed that some words of holy thanksgiving were being said, and I\\n\\nwished that I had stayed to hear them, and mark my especial gratitude\\n\\nfor having been spared to see that day. Then I heard the distant\\n\\nvoices, the deep tones of the men, the shriller pipes of women and\\n\\nchildren, join in the German harvest-hymn, which is generally sung on\\n\\nsuch occasions;[1] then silence, while I concluded that a blessing was\\n\\nspoken by the pastor, with outstretched arms; and then they once more\\n\\ndispersed, some to the village, some to finish their labours for the day\\n\\namong the vines. I saw Thekla coming through the garden with Max in her\\n\\narms, and Lina clinging to her woollen skirts. Thekla made for my open\\n\\nwindow; it was rather a shorter passage into the house than round by the\\n\\ndoor. \"I may come through, may I not?\" she asked, softly. \"I fear Max is\\n\\nnot well; I cannot understand his look, and he wakened up so strange!\"\\n\\nShe paused to let me see the child\\'s face; it was flushed almost to a\\n\\ncrimson look of heat, and his breathing was laboured and uneasy, his\\n\\neyes half-open and filmy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Something is wrong, I am sure,\" said I. \"I don\\'t know anything about\\n\\nchildren, but he is not in the least like himself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe bent down and kissed the cheek so tenderly that she would not have\\n\\nbruised the petal of a rose. \"Heart\\'s darling,\" she murmured. He\\n\\nquivered all over at her touch, working his fingers in an unnatural kind\\n\\nof way, and ending with a convulsive twitching all over his body. Lina\\n\\nbegan to cry at the grave, anxious look on our faces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You had better call the Frulein to look at him,\" said I. \"I feel sure\\n\\nhe ought to have a doctor; I should say he was going to have a fit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Frulein and the master are gone to the pastor\\'s for coffee, and\\n\\nLottchen is in the higher vineyard, taking the men their bread and beer.\\n\\nCould you find the kitchen girl, or old Karl? he will be in the stables,\\n\\nI think. I must lose no time.\" Almost without waiting for my reply, she\\n\\nhad passed through the room, and in the empty house I could hear her\\n\\nfirm, careful footsteps going up the stair; Lina\\'s pattering beside her;\\n\\nand the one voice wailing, the other speaking low comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was tired enough, but this good family had treated me too much like\\n\\none of their own for me not to do what I could in such a case as this. I\\n\\nmade my way out into the street, for the first time since I had come to\\n\\nthe house on that memorable evening six weeks ago. I bribed the first\\n\\nperson I met to guide me to the doctor\\'s, and send him straight down to\\n\\nthe \"Halbmond,\" not staying to listen to the thorough scolding he fell\\n\\nto giving me; then on to the parsonage, to tell the master and the\\n\\nFrulein of the state of things at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was sorry to be the bearer of bad news into such a festive chamber\\n\\nas the pastor\\'s. There they sat, resting after heat and fatigue, each\\n\\nin their best gala dress, the table spread with \"Dicker-milch,\"\\n\\npotato-salad, cakes of various shapes and kinds--all the dainty cates\\n\\ndear to the German palate. The pastor was talking to Herr Mller,\\n\\nwho stood near the pretty young Frulein Anna, in her fresh white\\n\\nchemisette, with her round white arms, and her youthful coquettish airs,\\n\\nas she prepared to pour out the coffee; our Frulein was talking busily\\n\\nto the Frau Mama; the younger boys and girls of the family filling up\\n\\nthe room. A ghost would have startled the assembled party less than I\\n\\ndid, and would probably have been more welcome, considering the news I\\n\\nbrought. As he listened, the master caught up his hat and went forth,\\n\\nwithout apology or farewell. Our Frulein made up for both, and\\n\\nquestioned me fully; but now she, I could see, was in haste to go,\\n\\nalthough restrained by her manners, and the kind-hearted Frau Pastorin\\n\\nsoon set her at liberty to follow her inclination. As for me I was\\n\\ndead-beat, and only too glad to avail myself of the hospitable couple\\'s\\n\\npressing request that I would stop and share their meal. Other magnates\\n\\nof the village came in presently, and relieved me of the strain of\\n\\nkeeping up a German conversation about nothing at all with entire\\n\\nstrangers. The pretty Frulein\\'s face had clouded over a little at Herr\\n\\nMller\\'s sudden departure; but she was soon as bright as could be,\\n\\ngiving private chase and sudden little scoldings to her brothers, as\\n\\nthey made raids upon the dainties under her charge. After I was duly\\n\\nrested and refreshed, I took my leave; for I, too, had my quieter\\n\\nanxieties about the sorrow in the Mller family.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe only person I could see at the \"Halbmond\" was Lottchen; every one\\n\\nelse was busy about the poor little Max, who was passing from one fit\\n\\ninto another. I told Lottchen to ask the doctor to come in and see me\\n\\nbefore he took his leave for the night, and tired as I was, I kept up\\n\\ntill after his visit, though it was very late before he came; I could\\n\\nsee from his face how anxious he was. He would give me no opinion as to\\n\\nthe child\\'s chances of recovery, from which I guessed that he had not\\n\\nmuch hope. But when I expressed my fear he cut me very short.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The truth is, you know nothing about it; no more do I, for that matter.\\n\\nIt is enough to try any man, much less a father, to hear his perpetual\\n\\nmoans--not that he is conscious of pain, poor little worm; but if she\\n\\nstops for a moment in her perpetual carrying him backwards and forwards,\\n\\nhe plains so piteously it is enough to--enough to make a man bless the\\n\\nLord who never led him into the pit of matrimony. To see the father up\\n\\nthere, following her as she walks up and down the room, the child\\'s head\\n\\nover her shoulder, and Mller trying to make the heavy eyes recognize\\n\\nthe old familiar ways of play, and the chirruping sounds which he can\\n\\nscarce make for crying----I shall be here to-morrow early, though before\\n\\nthat either life or death will have come without the old doctor\\'s help.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAll night long I dreamt my feverish dream--of the vineyard--the carts,\\n\\nwhich held little coffins instead of baskets of grapes--of the pastor\\'s\\n\\ndaughter, who would pull the dying child out of Thekla\\'s arms; it was\\n\\na bad, weary night! I slept long into the morning; the broad daylight\\n\\nfilled my room, and yet no one had been near to waken me! Did that mean\\n\\nlife or death? I got up and dressed as fast as I could; for I was aching\\n\\nall over with the fatigue of the day before. Out into the sitting-room;\\n\\nthe table was laid for breakfast, but no one was there. I passed into\\n\\nthe house beyond, up the stairs, blindly seeking for the room where I\\n\\nmight know whether it was life or death. At the door of a room I found\\n\\nLottchen crying; at the sight of me in that unwonted place she started,\\n\\nand began some kind of apology, broken both by tears and smiles, as she\\n\\ntold me that the doctor said the danger was over--past, and that Max was\\n\\nsleeping a gentle peaceful slumber in Thekla\\'s arms--arms that had held\\n\\nhim all through the livelong night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look at him, sir; only go in softly; it is a pleasure to see the child\\n\\nto-day; tread softly, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe opened the chamber-door. I could see Thekla sitting, propped up by\\n\\ncushions and stools, holding her heavy burden, and bending over him with\\n\\na look of tenderest love. Not far off stood the Frulein, all disordered\\n\\nand tearful, stirring or seasoning some hot soup, while the master stood\\n\\nby her impatient. As soon as it was cooled or seasoned enough he took\\n\\nthe basin and went to Thekla, and said something very low; she lifted up\\n\\nher head, and I could see her face; pale, weary with watching, but with\\n\\na soft peaceful look upon it, which it had not worn for weeks. Fritz\\n\\nMller began to feed her, for her hands were occupied in holding his\\n\\nchild; I could not help remembering Mrs. Inchbald\\'s pretty description\\n\\nof Dorriforth\\'s anxiety in feeding Miss Milner; she compares it, if I\\n\\nremember rightly, to that of a tender-hearted boy, caring for his\\n\\ndarling bird, the loss of which would embitter all the joys of his\\n\\nholidays. We closed the door without noise, so as not to waken the\\n\\nsleeping child. Lottchen brought me my coffee and bread; she was ready\\n\\neither to laugh or to weep on the slightest occasion. I could not tell\\n\\nif it was in innocence or mischief. She asked me the following\\n\\nquestion,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think Thekla will leave to-day, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the afternoon I heard Thekla\\'s step behind my extemporary screen. I\\n\\nknew it quite well. She stopped for a moment before emerging into my\\n\\nview.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was trying to look as composed as usual, but, perhaps because her\\n\\nsteady nerves had been shaken by her night\\'s watching, she could not\\n\\nhelp faint touches of dimples at the corners of her mouth, and her eyes\\n\\nwere veiled from any inquisitive look by their drooping lids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought you would like to know that the doctor says Max is quite out\\n\\nof danger now. He will only require care.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you, Thekla; Doctor ---- has been in already this afternoon to\\n\\ntell me so, and I am truly glad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe went to the window, and looked out for a moment. Many people were in\\n\\nthe vineyards again to-day; although we, in our household anxiety, had\\n\\npaid them but little heed. Suddenly she turned round into the room, and\\n\\nI saw that her face was crimson with blushes. In another instant Herr\\n\\nMller entered by the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Has she told you, sir?\" said he, possessing himself of her hand, and\\n\\nlooking all a-glow with happiness. \"Hast thou told our good friend?\"\\n\\naddressing her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. I was going to tell him, but I did not know how to begin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I will prompt thee. Say after me--\\'I have been a wilful, foolish\\n\\nwoman----\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe wrenched her hand out of his, half-laughing--\"I am a foolish woman,\\n\\nfor I have promised to marry him. But he is a still more foolish man,\\n\\nfor he wishes to marry me. That is what I say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I have sent Babette to Frankfort with the pastor. He is going\\n\\nthere, and will explain all to Frau v. Schmidt; and Babette will serve\\n\\nher for a time. When Max is well enough to have the change of air the\\n\\ndoctor prescribes for him, thou shalt take him to Altenahr, and thither\\n\\nwill I also go; and become known to thy people and thy father. And\\n\\nbefore Christmas the gentleman here shall dance at our wedding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must go home to England, dear friends, before many days are over.\\n\\nPerhaps we may travel together as far as Remagen. Another year I will\\n\\ncome back to Heppenheim and see you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I planned it, so it was. We left Heppenheim all together on a lovely\\n\\nAll-Saints\\' Day. The day before--the day of All-Souls--I had watched\\n\\nFritz and Thekla lead little Lina up to the Acre of God, the Field of\\n\\nRest, to hang the wreath of immortelles on her mother\\'s grave. Peace be\\n\\nwith the dead and the living.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIBBIE MARSH\\'S THREE ERAS.\\n\\n\\n\\nERA I.\\n\\n\\n\\nVALENTINE\\'S DAY.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast November but one, there was a flitting in our neighbourhood; hardly\\n\\na flitting, after all, for it was only a single person changing her\\n\\nplace of abode from one lodging to another; and instead of a cartload of\\n\\ndrawers and baskets, dressers and beds, with old king clock at the top\\n\\nof all, it was only one large wooden chest to be carried after the girl,\\n\\nwho moved slowly and heavily along the streets, listless and depressed,\\n\\nmore from the state of her mind than of her body. It was Libbie Marsh,\\n\\nwho had been obliged to quit her room in Dean Street, because the\\n\\nacquaintances whom she had been living with were leaving Manchester. She\\n\\ntried to think herself fortunate in having met with lodgings rather more\\n\\nout of the town, and with those who were known to be respectable; she\\n\\ndid indeed try to be contented, but in spite of her reason, the old\\n\\nfeeling of desolation came over her, as she was now about to be thrown\\n\\nagain entirely among strangers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. 2, ---- Court, Albemarle Street, was reached at last, and the pace,\\n\\nslow as it was, slackened as she drew near the spot where she was to be\\n\\nleft by the man who carried her box, for, trivial as her acquaintance\\n\\nwith him was, he was not quite a stranger, as every one else was,\\n\\npeering out of their open doors, and satisfying themselves it was only\\n\\n\"Dixon\\'s new lodger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDixon\\'s house was the last on the left-hand side of the court. A high\\n\\ndead brick wall connected it with its opposite neighbour. All the\\n\\ndwellings were of the same monotonous pattern, and one side of the court\\n\\nlooked at its exact likeness opposite, as if it were seeing itself in a\\n\\nlooking-glass.\\n\\n\\n\\nDixon\\'s house was shut up, and the key left next door; but the woman in\\n\\nwhose charge it was left knew that Libbie was expected, and came forward\\n\\nto say a few explanatory words, to unlock the door, and stir the dull\\n\\ngrey ashes that were lazily burning in the grate: and then she returned\\n\\nto her own house, leaving poor Libbie standing alone with the great big\\n\\nchest in the middle of the house-place floor, with no one to say a word\\n\\nto (even a common-place remark would have been better than this dull\\n\\nsilence), that could help her to repel the fast-coming tears.\\n\\n\\n\\nDixon and his wife, and their eldest girl, worked in factories, and were\\n\\nabsent all day from the house: the youngest child, also a little girl,\\n\\nwas boarded out on the week-days at the neighbour\\'s where the door-key\\n\\nwas deposited, but although busy making dirt-pies, at the entrance to\\n\\nthe court, when Libbie came in, she was too young to care much about her\\n\\nparents\\' new lodger. Libbie knew that she was to sleep with the elder\\n\\ngirl in the front bedroom, but, as you may fancy, it seemed a liberty\\n\\neven to go upstairs to take off her things, when no one was at home to\\n\\nmarshal the way up the ladder-like steps. So she could only take off her\\n\\nbonnet, and sit down, and gaze at the now blazing fire, and think\\n\\nsadly on the past, and on the lonely creature she was in this wide\\n\\nworld--father and mother gone, her little brother long since dead--he\\n\\nwould have been more than nineteen had he been alive, but she only thought of\\n\\nhim as the darling baby; her only friends (to call friends) living far\\n\\naway at their new house; her employers, kind enough people in their way,\\n\\nbut too rapidly twirling round on this bustling earth to have leisure to\\n\\nthink of the little work-woman, excepting when they wanted gowns turned,\\n\\ncarpets mended, or household linen darned; and hardly even the natural\\n\\nthough hidden hope of a young girl\\'s heart, to cheer her on with the\\n\\nbright visions of a home of her own at some future day, where, loving\\n\\nand beloved, she might fulfil a woman\\'s dearest duties.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Libbie was very plain, as she had known so long that the consciousness\\n\\nof it had ceased to mortify her. You can hardly live in Manchester\\n\\nwithout having some idea of your personal appearance: the factory lads\\n\\nand lasses take good care of that; and if you meet them at the hours\\n\\nwhen they are pouring out of the mills, you are sure to hear a good\\n\\nnumber of truths, some of them combined with such a spirit of impudent\\n\\nfun, that you can scarcely keep from laughing, even at the joke against\\n\\nyourself. Libbie had often and often been greeted by such questions\\n\\nas--\"How long is it since you were a beauty?\"--\"What would you take a\\n\\nday to stand in the fields to scare away the birds?\" &c., for her to\\n\\nlinger under any impression as to her looks.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile she was thus musing, and quietly crying, under the pictures her\\n\\nfancy had conjured up, the Dixons came dropping in, and surprised her\\n\\nwith her wet cheeks and quivering lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe almost wished to have the stillness again that had so oppressed her\\n\\nan hour ago, they talked and laughed so loudly and so much, and bustled\\n\\nabout so noisily over everything they did. Dixon took hold of one\\n\\niron handle of her box, and helped her to bump it upstairs, while his\\n\\ndaughter Anne followed to see the unpacking, and what sort of clothes\\n\\n\"little sewing body had gotten.\" Mrs. Dixon rattled out her tea-things,\\n\\nand put the kettle on, fetched home her youngest child, which added to\\n\\nthe commotion. Then she called Anne downstairs, and sent her for this\\n\\nthing and that: eggs to put to the cream, it was so thin; ham, to give a\\n\\nrelish to the bread and butter; some new bread, hot, if she could get\\n\\nit. Libbie heard all these orders, given at full pitch of Mrs. Dixon\\'s\\n\\nvoice, and wondered at their extravagance, so different from the habits\\n\\nof the place where she had last lodged. But they were fine spinners, in\\n\\nthe receipt of good wages; and confined all day in an atmosphere ranging\\n\\nfrom seventy-five to eighty degrees. They had lost all natural, healthy\\n\\nappetite for simple food, and, having no higher tastes, found their\\n\\ngreatest enjoyment in their luxurious meals.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen tea was ready, Libbie was called downstairs, with a rough but\\n\\nhearty invitation, to share their meal; she sat mutely at the corner of\\n\\nthe tea-table, while they went on with their own conversation about\\n\\npeople and things she knew nothing about, till at length she ventured\\n\\nto ask for a candle, to go and finish her unpacking before bedtime, as\\n\\nshe had to go out sewing for several succeeding days. But once in\\n\\nthe comparative peace of her bedroom, her energy failed her, and she\\n\\ncontented herself with locking her Noah\\'s ark of a chest, and put out\\n\\nher candle, and went to sit by the window, and gaze out at the bright\\n\\nheavens; for ever and ever \"the blue sky, that bends over all,\" sheds\\n\\ndown a feeling of sympathy with the sorrowful at the solemn hours when\\n\\nthe ceaseless stars are seen to pace its depths.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy-and-by her eye fell down to gazing at the corresponding window to her\\n\\nown, on the opposite side of the court. It was lighted, but the blind\\n\\nwas drawn down: upon the blind she saw, first unconsciously, the constant\\n\\nweary motion of a little spectral shadow, a child\\'s hand and arm--no\\n\\nmore; long, thin fingers hanging down from the wrist, while the arm\\n\\nmoved up and down, as if keeping time to the heavy pulses of dull pain.\\n\\nShe could not help hoping that sleep would soon come to still that\\n\\nincessant, feeble motion: and now and then it did cease, as if the\\n\\nlittle creature had dropped into a slumber from very weariness; but\\n\\npresently the arm jerked up with the fingers clenched, as if with a\\n\\nsudden start of agony. When Anne came up to bed, Libbie was still\\n\\nsitting, watching the shadow, and she directly asked to whom it\\n\\nbelonged.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It will be Margaret Hall\\'s lad. Last summer, when it was so hot, there\\n\\nwas no biding with the window shut at night, and theirs was open too:\\n\\nand many\\'s the time he has waked me with his moans; they say he\\'s been\\n\\nbetter sin\\' cold weather came.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is he always in bed? Whatten ails him?\" asked Libbie.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Summat\\'s amiss wi\\' his backbone, folks say; he\\'s better and worse,\\n\\nlike. He\\'s a nice little chap enough, and his mother\\'s not that bad\\n\\neither; only my mother and her had words, so now we don\\'t speak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie went on watching, and when she next spoke, to ask who and what\\n\\nhis mother was, Anne Dixon was fast asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime passed away, and as usual unveiled the hidden things. Libbie\\n\\nfound out that Margaret Hall was a widow, who earned her living as a\\n\\nwasherwoman; that the little suffering lad was her only child, her\\n\\ndearly beloved. That while she scolded, pretty nearly, everybody else,\\n\\n\"till her name was up\" in the neighbourhood for a termagant, to him she\\n\\nwas evidently most tender and gentle. He lay alone on his little bed,\\n\\nnear the window, through the day, while she was away toiling for a\\n\\nlivelihood. But when Libbie had plain sewing to do at her lodgings,\\n\\ninstead of going out to sew, she used to watch from her bedroom window\\n\\nfor the time when the shadows opposite, by their mute gestures, told\\n\\nthat the mother had returned to bend over her child, to smooth his\\n\\npillow, to alter his position, to get him his nightly cup of tea. And\\n\\noften in the night Libbie could not help rising gently from bed, to see\\n\\nif the little arm was waving up and down, as was his accustomed habit\\n\\nwhen sleepless from pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie had a good deal of sewing to do at home that winter, and whenever\\n\\nit was not so cold as to benumb her fingers, she took it upstairs, in\\n\\norder to watch the little lad in her few odd moments of pause. On his\\n\\nbetter days he could sit up enough to peep out of his window, and she\\n\\nfound he liked to look at her. Presently she ventured to nod to him\\n\\nacross the court; and his faint smile, and ready nod back again, showed\\n\\nthat this gave him pleasure. I think she would have been encouraged by\\n\\nthis smile to have proceeded to a speaking acquaintance, if it had not\\n\\nbeen for his terrible mother, to whom it seemed to be irritation enough\\n\\nto know that Libbie was a lodger at the Dixons\\' for her to talk at her\\n\\nwhenever they encountered each other, and to live evidently in wait for\\n\\nsome good opportunity of abuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith her constant interest in him, Libbie soon discovered his great want\\n\\nof an object on which to occupy his thoughts, and which might distract\\n\\nhis attention, when alone through the long day, from the pain he endured.\\n\\nHe was very fond of flowers. It was November when she had first removed\\n\\nto her lodgings, but it had been very mild weather, and a few flowers\\n\\nyet lingered in the gardens, which the country people gathered into\\n\\nnosegays, and brought on market-days into Manchester. His mother had\\n\\nbrought him a bunch of Michaelmas daisies the very day Libbie had become\\n\\na neighbour, and she watched their history. He put them first in an old\\n\\nteapot, of which the spout was broken off and the lid lost; and he daily\\n\\nreplenished the teapot from the jug of water his mother left near him to\\n\\nquench his feverish thirst. By-and-by, one or two of the constellation\\n\\nof lilac stars faded, and then the time he had hitherto spent in\\n\\nadmiring, almost caressing them, was devoted to cutting off those\\n\\nflowers whose decay marred the beauty of the nosegay. It took him half\\n\\nthe morning, with his feeble, languid motions, and his cumbrous old\\n\\nscissors, to trim up his diminished darlings. Then at last he seemed to\\n\\nthink he had better preserve the few that remained by drying them; so\\n\\nthey were carefully put between the leaves of the old Bible; and then,\\n\\nwhenever a better day came, when he had strength enough to lift the\\n\\nponderous book, he used to open the pages to look at his flower friends.\\n\\nIn winter he could have no more living flowers to tend.\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie thought and thought, till at last an idea flashed upon her mind,\\n\\nthat often made a happy smile steal over her face as she stitched away,\\n\\nand that cheered her through the solitary winter--for solitary it\\n\\ncontinued to be, though the Dixons were very good sort of people, never\\n\\npressed her for payment, if she had had but little work to do that week;\\n\\nnever grudged her a share of their extravagant meals, which were far\\n\\nmore luxurious than she could have met with anywhere else, for her\\n\\npreviously agreed payment in case of working at home; and they would\\n\\nfain have taught her to drink rum in her tea, assuring her that she\\n\\nshould have it for nothing and welcome. But they were too touchy, too\\n\\nprosperous, too much absorbed in themselves, to take off Libbie\\'s\\n\\nfeeling of solitariness; not half as much as the little face by day, and\\n\\nthe shadow by night, of him with whom she had never yet exchanged a\\n\\nword.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer idea was this: her mother came from the east of England, where, as\\n\\nperhaps you know, they have the pretty custom of sending presents on St.\\n\\nValentine\\'s day, with the donor\\'s name unknown, and, of course, the\\n\\nmystery constitutes half the enjoyment. The fourteenth of February was\\n\\nLibbie\\'s birthday too, and many a year, in the happy days of old, had\\n\\nher mother delighted to surprise her with some little gift, of which\\n\\nshe more than half-guessed the giver, although each Valentine\\'s day the\\n\\nmanner of its arrival was varied. Since then the fourteenth of February\\n\\nhad been the dreariest of all the year, because the most haunted by\\n\\nmemory of departed happiness. But now, this year, if she could not have\\n\\nthe old gladness of heart herself, she would try and brighten the life\\n\\nof another. She would save, and she would screw, but she would buy a\\n\\ncanary and a cage for that poor little laddie opposite, who wore out his\\n\\nmonotonous life with so few pleasures, and so much pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nI doubt I may not tell you here of the anxieties and the fears, of the\\n\\nhopes and the self-sacrifices--all, perhaps small in the tangible effect\\n\\nas the widow\\'s mite, yet not the less marked by the viewless angels who\\n\\ngo about continually among us--which varied Libbie\\'s life before she\\n\\naccomplished her purpose. It is enough to say it was accomplished. The\\n\\nvery day before the fourteenth she found time to go with her half-guinea\\n\\nto a barber\\'s who lived near Albemarle Street, and who was famous for\\n\\nhis stock of singing-birds. There are enthusiasts about all sorts of\\n\\nthings, both good and bad, and many of the weavers in Manchester know\\n\\nand care more about birds than any one would easily credit. Stubborn,\\n\\nsilent, reserved men on many things, you have only to touch on the\\n\\nsubject of birds to light up their faces with brightness. They will tell\\n\\nyou who won the prizes at the last canary show, where the prize birds\\n\\nmay be seen, and give you all the details of those funny, but pretty and\\n\\ninteresting mimicries of great people\\'s cattle shows. Among these\\n\\namateurs, Emanuel Morris the barber was an oracle.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took Libbie into his little back room, used for private shaving of\\n\\nmodest men, who did not care to be exhibited in the front shop decked\\n\\nout in the full glories of lather; and which was hung round with birds\\n\\nin rude wicker cages, with the exception of those who had won prizes,\\n\\nand were consequently honoured with gilt-wire prisons. The longer and\\n\\nthinner the body of the bird was, the more admiration it received, as\\n\\nfar as external beauty went; and when, in addition to this, the colour\\n\\nwas deep and clear, and its notes strong and varied, the more did Emanuel\\n\\ndwell upon its perfections. But these were all prize birds; and, on\\n\\ninquiry, Libbie heard, with some little sinking at heart, that their\\n\\nprice ran from one to two guineas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not over-particular as to shape and colour,\" said she, \"I should\\n\\nlike a good singer, that\\'s all!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe dropped a little in Emanuel\\'s estimation. However, he showed her his\\n\\ngood singers, but all were above Libbie\\'s means.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"After all, I don\\'t think I care so much about the singing very loud;\\n\\nit\\'s but a noise after all, and sometimes noise fidgets folks.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They must be nesh folks as is put out with the singing o\\' birds,\"\\n\\nreplied Emanuel, rather affronted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s for one who is poorly,\" said Libbie, deprecatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, as if considering the matter, \"folk that are cranky,\\n\\noften take more to them as shows \\'em love, than to them as is clever\\n\\nand gifted. Happen yo\\'d rather have this\\'n,\" opening a cage-door,\\n\\nand calling to a dull-coloured bird, sitting moped up in a corner,\\n\\n\"Here--Jupiter, Jupiter!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bird smoothed its feathers in an instant, and, uttering a little\\n\\nnote of delight, flew to Emanuel, putting his beak to his lips, as if\\n\\nkissing him, and then, perching on his head, it began a gurgling warble\\n\\nof pleasure, not by any means so varied or so clear as the song of the\\n\\nothers, but which pleased Libbie more; for she was always one to find\\n\\nout she liked the gooseberries that were accessible, better than the\\n\\ngrapes that were beyond her reach. The price too was just right, so\\n\\nshe gladly took possession of the cage, and hid it under her cloak,\\n\\npreparatory to carrying it home. Emanuel meanwhile was giving her\\n\\ndirections as to its food, with all the minuteness of one loving his\\n\\nsubject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will it soon get to know any one?\" asked she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Give him two days only, and you and he\\'ll be as thick as him and me are\\n\\nnow. You\\'ve only to open his door, and call him, and he\\'ll follow you\\n\\nround the room; but he\\'ll first kiss you, and then perch on your head.\\n\\nHe only wants larning, which I\\'ve no time to give him, to do many\\n\\nanother accomplishment.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s his name? I did not rightly catch it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Jupiter,--it\\'s not common; but the town\\'s o\\'errun with Bobbies and\\n\\nDickies, and as my birds are thought a bit out o\\' the way, I like to\\n\\nhave better names for \\'em, so I just picked a few out o\\' my lad\\'s school\\n\\nbooks. It\\'s just as ready, when you\\'re used to it, to say Jupiter as\\n\\nDicky.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I could bring my tongue round to Peter better; would he answer to\\n\\nPeter?\" asked Libbie, now on the point of departing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Happen he might; but I think he\\'d come readier to the three syllables.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Valentine\\'s day, Jupiter\\'s cage was decked round with ivy leaves,\\n\\nmaking quite a pretty wreath on the wicker work; and to one of them was\\n\\npinned a slip of paper, with these words, written in Libbie\\'s best round\\n\\nhand:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From your faithful Valentine. Please take notice his name is Peter, and\\n\\nhe\\'ll come if you call him, after a bit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut little work did Libbie do that afternoon, she was so engaged in\\n\\nwatching for the messenger who was to bear her present to her little\\n\\nvalentine, and run away as soon as he had delivered up the canary, and\\n\\nexplained to whom it was sent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last he came; then there was a pause before the woman of the house\\n\\nwas at liberty to take it upstairs. Then Libbie saw the little face\\n\\nflush up into a bright colour, the feeble hands tremble with delighted\\n\\neagerness, the head bent down to try and make out the writing (beyond\\n\\nhis power, poor lad, to read), the rapturous turning round of the cage\\n\\nin order to see the canary in every point of view, head, tail, wings,\\n\\nand feet; an intention in which Jupiter, in his uneasiness at being\\n\\nagain among strangers, did not second, for he hopped round so, as\\n\\ncontinually to present a full front to the boy. It was a source of never\\n\\nwearying delight to the little fellow, till daylight closed in; he\\n\\nevidently forgot to wonder who had sent it him, in his gladness at\\n\\nhis possession of such a treasure; and when the shadow of his mother\\n\\ndarkened on the blind, and the bird had been exhibited, Libbie saw her\\n\\ndo what, with all her tenderness, seemed rarely to have entered into her\\n\\nthoughts--she bent down and kissed her boy, in a mother\\'s sympathy with\\n\\nthe joy of her child.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe canary was placed for the night between the little bed and window;\\n\\nand when Libbie rose once, to take her accustomed peep, she saw the\\n\\nlittle arm put fondly round the cage, as if embracing his new treasure\\n\\neven in his sleep. How Jupiter slept this first night is quite another\\n\\nthing.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first day in Libbie\\'s three eras in last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nERA II.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHITSUNTIDE.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe brightest, fullest daylight poured down into No. 2, ---- Court,\\n\\nAlbemarle Street, and the heat, even at the early hour of five, as at\\n\\nthe noontide on the June days of many years past.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe court seemed alive, and merry with voices and laughter. The bedroom\\n\\nwindows were open wide, and had been so all night, on account of\\n\\nthe heat; and every now and then you might see a head and a pair of\\n\\nshoulders, simply encased in shirt sleeves, popped out, and you might\\n\\nhear the inquiry passed from one to the other,--\"Well, Jack, and where\\n\\nart thee bound for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dunham!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, what an old-fashioned chap thou be\\'st. Thy grandad afore thee went\\n\\nto Dunham: but thou wert always a slow coach. I\\'m off to Alderley,--me\\n\\nand my missis.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay, that\\'s because there\\'s only thee and thy missis. Wait till thou\\n\\nhast gotten four childer, like me, and thou\\'lt be glad enough to take\\n\\n\\'em to Dunham, oud-fashioned way, for fourpence apiece.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d still go to Alderley; I\\'d not be bothered with my children; they\\n\\nshould keep house at home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA pair of hands, the person to whom they belonged invisible, boxed his\\n\\nears on this last speech, in a very spirited, though playful, manner,\\n\\nand the neighbours all laughed at the surprised look of the speaker, at\\n\\nthis assault from an unseen foe. The man who had been holding\\n\\nconversation with him cried out,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sarved him right, Mrs. Slater: he knows nought about it yet; but\\n\\nwhen he gets them he\\'ll be as loth to leave the babbies at home on a\\n\\nWhitsuntide as any on us. We shall live to see him in Dunham Park yet,\\n\\nwi\\' twins in his arms, and another pair on \\'em clutching at daddy\\'s\\n\\ncoat-tails, let alone your share of youngsters, missis.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this moment our friend Libbie appeared at her window, and Mrs.\\n\\nSlater, who had taken her discomfited husband\\'s place, called out,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Elizabeth Marsh, where are Dixons and you bound to?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dixons are not up yet; he said last night he\\'d take his holiday out in\\n\\nlying in bed. I\\'m going to the old-fashioned place, Dunham.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou art never going by thyself, moping!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. I\\'m going with Margaret Hall and her lad,\" replied Libbie, hastily\\n\\nwithdrawing from the window, in order to avoid hearing any remarks on\\n\\nthe associates she had chosen for her day of pleasure--the scold of the\\n\\nneighbourhood, and her sickly, ailing child!\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Jupiter might have been a dove, and his ivy leaves an olive branch,\\n\\nfor the peace he had brought, the happiness he had caused, to three\\n\\nindividuals at least. For of course it could not long be a mystery who\\n\\nhad sent little Frank Hall his valentine; nor could his mother long\\n\\nentertain her hard manner towards one who had given her child a new\\n\\npleasure. She was shy, and she was proud, and for some time she struggled\\n\\nagainst the natural desire of manifesting her gratitude; but one evening,\\n\\nwhen Libbie was returning home, with a bundle of work half as large as\\n\\nherself, as she dragged herself along through the heated streets, she\\n\\nwas overtaken by Margaret Hall, her burden gently pulled from her, and\\n\\nher way home shortened, and her weary spirits soothed and cheered, by\\n\\nthe outpourings of Margaret\\'s heart; for the barrier of reserve once\\n\\nbroken down, she had much to say, to thank her for days of amusement and\\n\\nhappy employment for her lad, to speak of his gratitude, to tell of her\\n\\nhopes and fears,--the hopes and fears that made up the dates of her\\n\\nlife. From that time, Libbie lost her awe of the termagant in interest\\n\\nfor the mother, whose all was ventured in so frail a bark. From this\\n\\ntime, Libbie was a fast friend with both mother and son, planning\\n\\nmitigations for the sorrowful days of the latter as eagerly as poor\\n\\nMargaret Hall, and with far more success. His life had flickered up\\n\\nunder the charm and excitement of the last few months. He even seemed\\n\\nstrong enough to undertake the journey to Dunham, which Libbie had\\n\\narranged as a Whitsuntide treat, and for which she and his mother had\\n\\nbeen hoarding up for several weeks. The canal boat left Knott-mill at\\n\\nsix, and it was now past five; so Libbie let herself out very gently,\\n\\nand went across to her friends. She knocked at the door of their\\n\\nlodging-room, and, without waiting for an answer, entered.\\n\\n\\n\\nFranky\\'s face was flushed, and he was trembling with excitement,--partly\\n\\nwith pleasure, but partly with some eager wish not yet granted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He wants sore to take Peter with him,\" said his mother to Libbie, as if\\n\\nreferring the matter to her. The boy looked imploringly at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He would like it, I know; for one thing, he\\'d miss me sadly, and\\n\\nchirrup for me all day long, he\\'d be so lonely. I could not be half so\\n\\nhappy a-thinking on him, left alone here by himself. Then, Libbie, he\\'s\\n\\njust like a Christian, so fond of flowers and green leaves, and them\\n\\nsort of things. He chirrups to me so when mother brings me a pennyworth\\n\\nof wall-flowers to put round his cage. He would talk if he could, you\\n\\nknow; but I can tell what he means quite as one as if he spoke. Do let\\n\\nPeter go, Libbie; I\\'ll carry him in my own arms.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Jupiter was allowed to be of the party. Now Libbie had overcome the\\n\\ngreat difficulty of conveying Franky to the boat, by offering to \"slay\"\\n\\nfor a coach, and the shouts and exclamations of the neighbours told\\n\\nthem that their conveyance awaited them at the bottom of the court. His\\n\\nmother carried Franky, light in weight, though heavy in helplessness,\\n\\nand he would hold the cage, believing that he was thus redeeming his\\n\\npledge, that Peter should be a trouble to no one. Libbie proceeded to\\n\\narrange the bundle containing their dinner, as a support in the corner\\n\\nof the coach. The neighbours came out with many blunt speeches, and more\\n\\nkindly wishes, and one or two of them would have relieved Margaret of\\n\\nher burden, if she would have allowed it. The presence of that little\\n\\ncrippled fellow seemed to obliterate all the angry feelings which had\\n\\nexisted between his mother and her neighbours, and which had formed the\\n\\npolitics of that little court for many a day.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now they were fairly off! Franky bit his lips in attempted endurance\\n\\nof the pain the motion caused him; he winced and shrank, until they\\n\\nwere fairly on a Macadamized thoroughfare, when he closed his eyes, and\\n\\nseemed desirous of a few minutes\\' rest. Libbie felt very shy, and very\\n\\nmuch afraid of being seen by her employers, \"set up in a coach!\" and\\n\\nso she hid herself in a corner, and made herself as small as possible;\\n\\nwhile Mrs. Hall had exactly the opposite feeling, and was delighted to\\n\\nstand up, stretching out of the window, and nodding to pretty nearly\\n\\nevery one they met or passed on the foot-paths; and they were not a few,\\n\\nfor the streets were quite gay, even at that early hour, with parties\\n\\ngoing to this or that railway station, or to the boats which crowded the\\n\\ncanals on this bright holiday week; and almost every one they met seemed\\n\\nto enter into Mrs. Hall\\'s exhilaration of feeling, and had a smile or\\n\\nnod in return. At last she plumped down by Libbie, and exclaimed, \"I\\n\\nnever was in a coach but once afore, and that was when I was a-going to\\n\\nbe married. It\\'s like heaven; and all done over with such beautiful\\n\\ngimp, too!\" continued she, admiring the lining of the vehicle. Jupiter\\n\\ndid not enjoy it so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if the holiday time, the lovely weather, and the \"sweet hour of\\n\\nprime\" had a genial influence, as no doubt they have, everybody\\'s heart\\n\\nseemed softened towards poor Franky. The driver lifted him out with the\\n\\ntenderness of strength, and bore him carefully down to the boat; the\\n\\npeople then made way, and gave him the best seat in their power,--or\\n\\nrather I should call it a couch, for they saw he was weary, and insisted\\n\\non his lying down,--an attitude he would have been ashamed to assume\\n\\nwithout the protection of his mother and Libbie, who now appeared,\\n\\nbearing their baskets and carrying Peter.\\n\\n\\n\\nAway the boat went, to make room for others, for every conveyance,\\n\\nboth by land and water, is in requisition in Whitsun-week, to give\\n\\nthe hard-worked crowds the opportunity of enjoying the charms of the\\n\\ncountry. Even every standing-place in the canal packets was occupied,\\n\\nand as they glided along, the banks were lined with people, who seemed\\n\\nto find it object enough to watch the boats go by, packed close and full\\n\\nwith happy beings brimming with anticipations of a day\\'s pleasure. The\\n\\ncountry through which they passed is as uninteresting as can well be\\n\\nimagined; but still it is the country: and the screams of delight from\\n\\nthe children, and the low laughs of pleasure from the parents, at every\\n\\nblossoming tree that trailed its wreath against some cottage wall, or\\n\\nat the tufts of late primroses which lingered in the cool depths of\\n\\ngrass along the canal banks, the thorough relish of everything, as\\n\\nif dreading to let the least circumstance of this happy day pass over\\n\\nwithout its due appreciation, made the time seem all too short, although\\n\\nit took two hours to arrive at a place only eight miles from Manchester.\\n\\nEven Franky, with all his impatience to see Dunham woods (which I think\\n\\nhe confused with London, believing both to be paved with gold), enjoyed\\n\\nthe easy motion of the boat so much, floating along, while pictures\\n\\nmoved before him, that he regretted when the time came for landing among\\n\\nthe soft, green meadows, that came sloping down to the dancing water\\'s\\n\\nbrim. His fellow-passengers carried him to the park, and refused all\\n\\npayment, although his mother had laid by sixpence on purpose, as a\\n\\nrecompense for this service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Libbie, how beautiful! Oh, mother, mother! is the whole world out\\n\\nof Manchester as beautiful as this? I did not know trees were like this!\\n\\nSuch green homes for birds! Look, Peter! would not you like to be there,\\n\\nup among those boughs? But I can\\'t let you go, you know, because you\\'re\\n\\nmy little bird brother, and I should be quite lost without you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey spread a shawl upon the fine mossy turf, at the root of a\\n\\nbeech-tree, which made a sort of natural couch, and there they laid him,\\n\\nand bade him rest, in spite of the delight which made him believe\\n\\nhimself capable of any exertion. Where he lay,--always holding Jupiter\\'s\\n\\ncage, and often talking to him as to a playfellow,--he was on the verge\\n\\nof a green area, shut in by magnificent trees, in all the glory of their\\n\\nearly foliage, before the summer heats had deepened their verdure into\\n\\none rich, monotonous tint. And hither came party after party; old men\\n\\nand maidens, young men and children,--whole families trooped along after\\n\\nthe guiding fathers, who bore the youngest in their arms, or astride\\n\\nupon their backs, while they turned round occasionally to the wives,\\n\\nwith whom they shared some fond local remembrance. For years has Dunham\\n\\nPark been the favourite resort of the Manchester work-people; for more\\n\\nyears than I can tell; probably ever since \"the Duke,\" by his canals,\\n\\nopened out the system of cheap travelling. Its scenery, too, which\\n\\npresents such a complete contrast to the whirl and turmoil of Manchester;\\n\\nso thoroughly woodland, with its ancestral trees (here and there\\n\\nlightning blanched); its \"verdurous walls;\" its grassy walks, leading\\n\\nfar away into some glade, where you start at the rabbit rustling among\\n\\nthe last year\\'s fern, and where the wood-pigeon\\'s call seems the only\\n\\nfitting and accordant sound. Depend upon it, this complete sylvan\\n\\nrepose, this accessible quiet, this lapping the soul in green images of\\n\\nthe country, forms the most complete contrast to a town\\'s-person, and\\n\\nconsequently has over such the greatest power to charm.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Libbie found out she was very hungry. Now they were but\\n\\nprovided with dinner, which was, of course, to be eaten as near twelve\\n\\no\\'clock as might be; and Margaret Hall, in her prudence, asked a\\n\\nworking-man near to tell her what o\\'clock it was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"I\\'ll ne\\'er look at clock or watch to-day. I\\'ll not\\n\\nspoil my pleasure by finding out how fast it\\'s going away. If thou\\'rt\\n\\nhungry, eat. I make my own dinner hour, and I have eaten mine an hour\\n\\nago.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo they had their veal pies, and then found out it was only about\\n\\nhalf-past ten o\\'clock; by so many pleasurable events had that morning\\n\\nbeen marked. But such was their buoyancy of spirits, that they only\\n\\nenjoyed their mistake, and joined in the general laugh against the man\\n\\nwho had eaten his dinner somewhere about nine. He laughed most heartily\\n\\nof all, till, suddenly stopping, he said,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must not go on at this rate; laughing gives one such an appetite.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! if that\\'s all,\" said a merry-looking man, lying at full length, and\\n\\nbrushing the fresh scent out of the grass, while two or three little\\n\\nchildren tumbled over him, and crept about him, as kittens or puppies\\n\\nfrolic with their parents, \"if that\\'s all, we\\'ll have a subscription of\\n\\neatables for them improvident folk as have eaten their dinner for their\\n\\nbreakfast. Here\\'s a sausage pasty and a handful of nuts for my share.\\n\\nBring round a hat, Bob, and see what the company will give.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBob carried out the joke, much to little Franky\\'s amusement; and no one\\n\\nwas so churlish as to refuse, although the contributions varied from a\\n\\npeppermint drop up to a veal pie and a sausage pasty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a thriving trade,\" said Bob, as he emptied his hatful of\\n\\nprovisions on the grass by Libbie\\'s side. \"Besides, it\\'s tiptop, too, to\\n\\nlive on the public. Hark! what is that?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe laughter and the chat were suddenly hushed, and mothers told their\\n\\nlittle ones to listen,--as, far away in the distance, now sinking and\\n\\nfalling, now swelling and clear, came a ringing peal of children\\'s\\n\\nvoices, blended together in one of those psalm tunes which we are all\\n\\nof us familiar with, and which bring to mind the old, old days, when we,\\n\\nas wondering children, were first led to worship \"Our Father,\" by those\\n\\nbeloved ones who have since gone to the more perfect worship. Holy was\\n\\nthat distant choral praise, even to the most thoughtless; and when it,\\n\\nin fact, was ended, in the instant\\'s pause, during which the ear awaits\\n\\nthe repetition of the air, they caught the noontide hum and buzz of the\\n\\nmyriads of insects who danced away their lives in the glorious day; they\\n\\nheard the swaying of the mighty woods in the soft but resistless breeze,\\n\\nand then again once more burst forth the merry jests and the shouts of\\n\\nchildhood; and again the elder ones resumed their happy talk, as they\\n\\nlay or sat \"under the greenwood tree.\" Fresh parties came dropping in;\\n\\nsome laden with wild flowers--almost with branches of hawthorn, indeed;\\n\\nwhile one or two had made prizes of the earliest dog-roses, and had cast\\n\\naway campion, stitchwort, ragged robin, all to keep the lady of the\\n\\nhedges from being obscured or hidden by the community.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne after another drew near to Franky, and looked on with interest as he\\n\\nlay sorting the flowers given to him. Happy parents stood by, with their\\n\\nhousehold bands around them, in health and comeliness, and felt the\\n\\nsad prophecy of those shrivelled limbs, those wasted fingers, those\\n\\nlamp-like eyes, with their bright, dark lustre. His mother was too\\n\\neagerly watching his happiness to read the meaning of those grave looks,\\n\\nbut Libbie saw them and understood them; and a chill shudder went\\n\\nthrough her, even on that day, as she thought on the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay! I thought we should give you a start!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA start they did give, with their terrible slap on Libbie\\'s back, as she\\n\\nsat idly grouping flowers, and following out her sorrowful thoughts. It\\n\\nwas the Dixons. Instead of keeping their holiday by lying in bed, they\\n\\nand their children had roused themselves, and had come by the omnibus to\\n\\nthe nearest point. For an instant the meeting was an awkward one, on\\n\\naccount of the feud between Margaret Hall and Mrs. Dixon, but there was\\n\\nno long resisting of kindly mother Nature\\'s soothings, at that holiday\\n\\ntime, and in that lonely tranquil spot; or if they could have been\\n\\nunheeded, the sight of Franky would have awed every angry feeling\\n\\ninto rest, so changed was he since the Dixons had last seen him; and\\n\\nsince he had been the Puck or Robin Goodfellow of the neighbourhood,\\n\\nwhose marbles were always rolling under other people\\'s feet, and whose\\n\\ntop-strings were always hanging in nooses to catch the unwary. Yes, he,\\n\\nthe feeble, mild, almost girlish-looking lad, had once been a merry,\\n\\nhappy rogue, and as such often cuffed by Mrs. Dixon, the very Mrs. Dixon\\n\\nwho now stood gazing with the tears in her eyes. Could she, in sight of\\n\\nhim, the changed, the fading, keep up a quarrel with his mother?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How long hast thou been here?\" asked Dixon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Welly on for all day,\" answered Libbie.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hast never been to see the deer, or the king and queen oaks? Lord, how\\n\\nstupid.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis wife pinched his arm, to remind him of Franky\\'s helpless condition,\\n\\nwhich of course tethered the otherwise willing feet. But Dixon had a\\n\\nremedy. He called Bob, and one or two others, and each taking a corner\\n\\nof the strong plaid shawl, they slung Franky as in a hammock, and thus\\n\\ncarried him merrily along, down the wood paths, over the smooth, grassy\\n\\nturf, while the glimmering shine and shadow fell on his upturned face.\\n\\nThe women walked behind, talking, loitering along, always in sight of\\n\\nthe hammock; now picking up some green treasure from the ground, now\\n\\ncatching at the low hanging branches of the horse-chestnut. The soul\\n\\ngrew much on this day, and in these woods, and all unconsciously, as\\n\\nsouls do grow. They followed Franky\\'s hammock-bearers up a grassy knoll,\\n\\non the top of which stood a group of pine trees, whose stems looked like\\n\\ndark red gold in the sunbeams. They had taken Franky there to show him\\n\\nManchester, far away in the blue plain, against which the woodland\\n\\nforeground cut with a soft clear line. Far, far away in the distance on\\n\\nthat flat plain, you might see the motionless cloud of smoke hanging\\n\\nover a great town, and that was Manchester,--ugly, smoky Manchester,\\n\\ndear, busy, earnest, noble-working Manchester; where their children had\\n\\nbeen born, and where, perhaps, some lay buried; where their homes were,\\n\\nand where God had cast their lives, and told them to work out their\\n\\ndestiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hurrah! for oud smoke-jack!\" cried Bob, putting Franky softly down on\\n\\nthe grass, before he whirled his hat round, preparatory to a shout.\\n\\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" from all the men. \"There\\'s the rim of my hat lying\\n\\nlike a quoit yonder,\" observed Bob quietly, as he replaced his brimless\\n\\nhat on his head with the gravity of a judge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the Sunday-school children a-coming to sit on this shady side,\\n\\nand have their buns and milk. Hark! they\\'re singing the infant-school\\n\\ngrace.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey sat close at hand, so that Franky could hear the words they sang,\\n\\nin rings of children, making, in their gay summer prints, newly donned\\n\\nfor that week, garlands of little faces, all happy and bright upon that\\n\\ngreen hill-side. One little \"Dot\" of a girl came shily behind Franky,\\n\\nwhom she had long been watching, and threw her half-bun at his side, and\\n\\nthen ran away and hid herself, in very shame at the boldness of her own\\n\\nsweet impulse. She kept peeping from her screen at Franky all the time;\\n\\nand he meanwhile was almost too much pleased and happy to eat; the world\\n\\nwas so beautiful, and men, women, and children all so tender and kind;\\n\\nso softened, in fact, by the beauty of this earth, so unconsciously\\n\\ntouched by the spirit of love, which was the Creator of this lovely\\n\\nearth. But the day drew to an end; the heat declined; the birds once\\n\\nmore began their warblings; the fresh scents again hung about plant,\\n\\nand tree, and grass, betokening the fragrant presence of the reviving\\n\\ndew, and--the boat time was near. As they trod the meadow-path once\\n\\nmore, they were joined by many a party they had encountered during\\n\\nthe day, all abounding in happiness, all full of the day\\'s adventures.\\n\\nLong-cherished quarrels had been forgotten, new friendships formed.\\n\\nFresh tastes and higher delights had been imparted that day. We have all\\n\\nof us our look, now and then, called up by some noble or loving thought\\n\\n(our highest on earth), which will be our likeness in heaven. I can\\n\\ncatch the glance on many a face, the glancing light of the cloud of\\n\\nglory from heaven, \"which is our home.\" That look was present on many a\\n\\nhard-worked, wrinkled countenance, as they turned backwards to catch a\\n\\nlonging, lingering look at Dunham woods, fast deepening into blackness\\n\\nof night, but whose memory was to haunt, in greenness and freshness,\\n\\nmany a loom, and workshop, and factory, with images of peace and beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night, as Libbie lay awake, revolving the incidents of the day, she\\n\\ncaught Franky\\'s voice through the open windows. Instead of the frequent\\n\\nmoan of pain, he was trying to recall the burden of one of the\\n\\nchildren\\'s hymns,--\\n\\n\\n\\n  Here we suffer grief and pain,\\n\\n  Here we meet to part again;\\n\\n    In Heaven we part no more.\\n\\n          Oh! that will be joyful, &c.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe recalled his question, the whispered question, to her, in the\\n\\nhappiest part of the day. He asked Libbie, \"Is Dunham like heaven? the\\n\\npeople here are as kind as angels, and I don\\'t want heaven to be more\\n\\nbeautiful than this place. If you and mother would but die with me, I\\n\\nshould like to die, and live always there!\" She had checked him, for\\n\\nshe feared he was impious; but now the young child\\'s craving for some\\n\\ndefinite idea of the land to which his inner wisdom told him he was\\n\\nhastening, had nothing in it wrong, or even sorrowful, for--\\n\\n\\n\\n  In Heaven we part no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nERA III.\\n\\n\\n\\nMICHAELMAS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe church clocks had struck three; the crowds of gentlemen returning to\\n\\nbusiness, after their early dinners, had disappeared within offices and\\n\\nwarehouses; the streets were clear and quiet, and ladies were venturing\\n\\nto sally forth for their afternoon shoppings and their afternoon calls.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly, slowly, along the streets, elbowed by life at every turn, a\\n\\nlittle funeral wound its quiet way. Four men bore along a child\\'s\\n\\ncoffin; two women with bowed heads followed meekly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI need not tell you whose coffin it was, or who were those two\\n\\nmourners. All was now over with little Frank Hall: his romps, his games,\\n\\nhis sickening, his suffering, his death. All was now over, but the\\n\\nResurrection and the Life.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis mother walked as in a stupor. Could it be that he was dead! If he\\n\\nhad been less of an object of her thoughts, less of a motive for her\\n\\nlabours, she could sooner have realized it. As it was, she followed\\n\\nhis poor, cast-off, worn-out body as if she were borne along by some\\n\\noppressive dream. If he were really dead, how could she be still alive?\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie\\'s mind was far less stunned, and consequently far more active,\\n\\nthan Margaret Hall\\'s. Visions, as in a phantasmagoria, came rapidly\\n\\npassing before her--recollections of the time (which seemed now so\\n\\nlong ago) when the shadow of the feebly-waving arm first caught her\\n\\nattention; of the bright, strangely isolated day at Dunham Park, where\\n\\nthe world had seemed so full of enjoyment, and beauty, and life; of\\n\\nthe long-continued heat, through which poor Franky had panted away his\\n\\nstrength in the little close room, where there was no escaping the hot\\n\\nrays of the afternoon sun; of the long nights when his mother and she\\n\\nhad watched by his side, as he moaned continually, whether awake or\\n\\nasleep; of the fevered moaning slumber of exhaustion; of the pitiful\\n\\nlittle self-upbraidings for his own impatience of suffering, only\\n\\nimpatient in his own eyes--most true and holy patience in the sight\\n\\nof others; and then the fading away of life, the loss of power, the\\n\\nincreased unconsciousness, the lovely look of angelic peace, which\\n\\nfollowed the dark shadow on the countenance, where was he--what was he\\n\\nnow?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so they laid him in his grave, and heard the solemn funeral words;\\n\\nbut far off in the distance, as if not addressed to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nMargaret Hall bent over the grave to catch one last glance--she had\\n\\nnot spoken, nor sobbed, nor done aught but shiver now and then, since\\n\\nthe morning; but now her weight bore more heavily on Libbie\\'s arm,\\n\\nand without sigh or sound she fell an unconscious heap on the piled-up\\n\\ngravel. They helped Libbie to bring her round; but long after her\\n\\nhalf-opened eyes and altered breathing showed that her senses were\\n\\nrestored, she lay, speechless and motionless, without attempting to rise\\n\\nfrom her strange bed, as if the earth contained nothing worth even that\\n\\ntrifling exertion.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last Libbie and she left that holy, consecrated spot, and bent\\n\\ntheir steps back to the only place more consecrated still; where he had\\n\\nrendered up his spirit; and where memories of him haunted each common,\\n\\nrude piece of furniture that their eyes fell upon. As the woman of the\\n\\nhouse opened the door, she pulled Libbie on one side, and said--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anne Dixon has been across to see you; she wants to have a word with\\n\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot go now,\" replied Libbie, as she pushed hastily along, in order\\n\\nto enter the room (_his_ room), at the same time with the childless\\n\\nmother: for, as she had anticipated, the sight of that empty spot, the\\n\\nglance at the uncurtained open window, letting in the fresh air, and the\\n\\nbroad, rejoicing light of day, where all had so long been darkened and\\n\\nsubdued, unlocked the waters of the fountain, and long and shrill were\\n\\nthe cries for her boy that the poor woman uttered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs. Hall,\" said Libbie, herself drenched in tears, \"do not\\n\\ntake on so badly; I\\'m sure it would grieve _him_ sore if he were alive,\\n\\nand you know he is--Bible tells us so; and may be he\\'s here watching how\\n\\nwe go on without him, and hoping we don\\'t fret over much.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Hall\\'s sobs grew worse and more hysterical.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! listen,\" said Libbie, once more struggling against her own increasing\\n\\nagitation. \"Listen! there\\'s Peter chirping as he always does when he\\'s\\n\\nput about, frightened like; and you know he that\\'s gone could never\\n\\nabide to hear the canary chirp in that shrill way.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMargaret Hall did check herself, and curb her expressions of agony,\\n\\nin order not to frighten the little creature he had loved; and as her\\n\\noutward grief subsided, Libbie took up the large old Bible, which fell\\n\\nopen at the never-failing comfort of the fourteenth chapter of St.\\n\\nJohn\\'s Gospel.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow often these large family Bibles do open at that chapter! as if,\\n\\nunused in more joyous and prosperous times, the soul went home to its\\n\\nwords of loving sympathy when weary and sorrowful, just as the little\\n\\nchild seeks the tender comfort of its mother in all its griefs and\\n\\ncares.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Margaret put back her wet, ruffled, grey hair from her heated,\\n\\ntear-stained, woeful face, and listened with such earnest eyes, trying\\n\\nto form some idea of the \"Father\\'s house,\" where her boy had gone to\\n\\ndwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were interrupted by a low tap at the door. Libbie went. \"Anne Dixon\\n\\nhas watched you home, and wants to have a word with you,\" said the woman\\n\\nof the house, in a whisper. Libbie went back and closed the book, with a\\n\\nword of explanation to Margaret Hall, and then ran downstairs, to learn\\n\\nthe reason of Anne\\'s anxiety to see her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Libbie!\" she burst out with, and then, checking herself with the\\n\\nremembrance of Libbie\\'s last solemn duty, \"how\\'s Margaret Hall? But,\\n\\nof course, poor thing, she\\'ll fret a bit at first; she\\'ll be some time\\n\\ncoming round, mother says, seeing it\\'s as well that poor lad is taken;\\n\\nfor he\\'d always ha\\' been a cripple, and a trouble to her--he was a fine\\n\\nlad once, too.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had come full of another and a different subject; but the sight of\\n\\nLibbie\\'s sad, weeping face, and the quiet, subdued tone of her manner,\\n\\nmade her feel it awkward to begin on any other theme than the one which\\n\\nfilled up her companion\\'s mind. To her last speech Libbie answered\\n\\nsorrowfully--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No doubt, Anne, it\\'s ordered for the best; but oh! don\\'t call him,\\n\\ndon\\'t think he could ever ha\\' been, a trouble to his mother, though he\\n\\nwere a cripple. She loved him all the more for each thing she had to do\\n\\nfor him--I am sure I did.\" Libbie cried a little behind her apron. Anne\\n\\nDixon felt still more awkward in introducing the discordant subject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! \\'flesh is grass,\\' Bible says,\" and having fulfilled the etiquette\\n\\nof quoting a text if possible, if not of making a moral observation on\\n\\nthe fleeting nature of earthly things, she thought she was at liberty to\\n\\npass on to her real errand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You must not go on moping yourself, Libbie Marsh. What I wanted special\\n\\nfor to see you this afternoon, was to tell you, you must come to my\\n\\nwedding to-morrow. Nanny Dawson has fallen sick, and there\\'s none as I\\n\\nshould like to have bridesmaid in her place as well as you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To-morrow! Oh, I cannot!--indeed I cannot!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie did not answer, and Anne Dixon grew impatient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Surely, in the name o\\' goodness, you\\'re never going to baulk yourself\\n\\nof a day\\'s pleasure for the sake of yon little cripple that\\'s dead and\\n\\ngone!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,--it\\'s not baulking myself of--don\\'t be angry, Anne Dixon, with him,\\n\\nplease; but I don\\'t think it would be a pleasure to me,--I don\\'t feel as\\n\\nif I could enjoy it; thank you all the same. But I did love that little\\n\\nlad very dearly--I did,\" sobbing a little, \"and I can\\'t forget him and\\n\\nmake merry so soon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well--I never!\" exclaimed Anne, almost angrily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed, Anne, I feel your kindness, and you and Bob have my best\\n\\nwishes,--that\\'s what you have; but even if I went, I should be thinking\\n\\nall day of him, and of his poor, poor mother, and they say it\\'s bad to\\n\\nthink very much on them that\\'s dead, at a wedding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense,\" said Anne, \"I\\'ll take the risk of the ill-luck. After all,\\n\\nwhat is marrying? Just a spree, Bob says. He often says he does not\\n\\nthink I shall make him a good wife, for I know nought about house\\n\\nmatters, wi\\' working in a factory; but he says he\\'d rather be uneasy wi\\'\\n\\nme than easy wi\\' anybody else. There\\'s love for you! And I tell him I\\'d\\n\\nrather have him tipsy than any one else sober.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! Anne Dixon, hush! you don\\'t know yet what it is to have a drunken\\n\\nhusband. I have seen something of it: father used to get fuddled, and,\\n\\nin the long run, it killed mother, let alone--oh! Anne, God above only\\n\\nknows what the wife of a drunken man has to bear. Don\\'t tell,\" said she,\\n\\nlowering her voice, \"but father killed our little baby in one of his\\n\\nbouts; mother never looked up again, nor father either, for that matter,\\n\\nonly his was in a different way. Mother will have gotten to little\\n\\nJemmie now, and they\\'ll be so happy together,--and perhaps Franky too.\\n\\nOh!\" said she, recovering herself from her train of thought, \"never say\\n\\naught lightly of the wife\\'s lot whose husband is given to drink!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dear, what a preachment. I tell you what, Libbie, you\\'re as born an\\n\\nold maid as ever I saw. You\\'ll never be married to either drunken or\\n\\nsober.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLibbie\\'s face went rather red, but without losing its meek expression.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know that as well as you can tell me; and more reason, therefore, as\\n\\nGod has seen fit to keep me out of woman\\'s natural work, I should try\\n\\nand find work for myself. I mean,\" seeing Anne Dixon\\'s puzzled look,\\n\\n\"that as I know I\\'m never likely to have a home of my own, or a husband\\n\\nthat would look to me to make all straight, or children to watch over or\\n\\ncare for, all which I take to be woman\\'s natural work, I must not lose\\n\\ntime in fretting and fidgetting after marriage, but just look about me\\n\\nfor somewhat else to do. I can see many a one misses it in this. They\\n\\nwill hanker after what is ne\\'er likely to be theirs, instead of facing\\n\\nit out, and settling down to be old maids; and, as old maids, just\\n\\nlooking round for the odd jobs God leaves in the world for such as old\\n\\nmaids to do. There\\'s plenty of such work, and there\\'s the blessing of\\n\\nGod on them as does it.\" Libbie was almost out of breath at this\\n\\noutpouring of what had long been her inner thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s all very true, I make no doubt, for them as is to be old maids;\\n\\nbut as I\\'m not, please God to-morrow comes, you might have spared your\\n\\nbreath to cool your porridge. What I want to know is, whether you\\'ll be\\n\\nbridesmaid to-morrow or not. Come, now do; it will do you good, after\\n\\nall your working, and watching, and slaving yourself for that poor\\n\\nFranky Hall.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was one of my odd jobs,\" said Libbie, smiling, though her eyes were\\n\\nbrimming over with tears; \"but, dear Anne,\" said she, recovering\\n\\nitself, \"I could not do it to-morrow, indeed I could not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I can\\'t wait,\" said Anne Dixon, almost sulkily, \"Bob and I put it\\n\\noff from to-day, because of the funeral, and Bob had set his heart on\\n\\nits being on Michaelmas-day; and mother says the goose won\\'t keep beyond\\n\\nto-morrow. Do come: father finds eatables, and Bob finds drink, and we\\n\\nshall be so jolly! and after we\\'ve been to church, we\\'re to walk round\\n\\nthe town in pairs, white satin ribbon in our bonnets, and refreshments\\n\\nat any public-house we like, Bob says. And after dinner there\\'s to be a\\n\\ndance. Don\\'t be a fool; you can do no good by staying. Margaret Hall\\n\\nwill have to go out washing, I\\'ll be bound.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, she must go to Mrs. Wilkinson\\'s, and, for that matter, I must go\\n\\nworking too. Mrs. Williams has been after me to make her girl\\'s winter\\n\\nthings ready; only I could not leave Franky, he clung so to me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then you won\\'t be bridesmaid! is that your last word?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is; you must not be angry with me, Anne Dixon,\" said Libbie,\\n\\ndeprecatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Anne was gone without a reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a heavy heart Libbie mounted the little staircase, for she felt\\n\\nhow ungracious her refusal of Anne\\'s kindness must appear, to one who\\n\\nunderstood so little the feelings which rendered her acceptance of it a\\n\\nmoral impossibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn opening the door she saw Margaret Hall, with the Bible open on the\\n\\ntable before her. For she had puzzled out the place where Libbie was\\n\\nreading, and, with her finger under the line, was spelling out the words\\n\\nof consolation, piecing the syllables together aloud, with the earnest\\n\\nanxiety of comprehension with which a child first learns to read. So\\n\\nLibbie took the stool by her side, before she was aware that any one had\\n\\nentered the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What did she want you for?\" asked Margaret. \"But I can guess; she\\n\\nwanted you to be at th\\' wedding that is to come off this week, they say.\\n\\nAy, they\\'ll marry, and laugh, and dance, all as one as if my boy was\\n\\nalive,\" said she, bitterly. \"Well, he was neither kith nor kin of yours,\\n\\nso I maun try and be thankful for what you\\'ve done for him, and not\\n\\nwonder at your forgetting him afore he\\'s well settled in his grave.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I never can forget him, and I\\'m not going to the wedding,\" said Libbie,\\n\\nquietly, for she understood the mother\\'s jealousy of her dead child\\'s\\n\\nclaims.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must go work at Mrs. Williams\\' to-morrow,\" she said, in explanation,\\n\\nfor she was unwilling to boast of her tender, fond regret, which had\\n\\nbeen her principal motive for declining Anne\\'s invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I mun go washing, just as if nothing had happened,\" sighed forth\\n\\nMrs. Hall, \"and I mun come home at night, and find his place empty, and\\n\\nall still where I used to be sure of hearing his voice ere ever I got\\n\\nup the stair: no one will ever call me mother again.\" She fell crying\\n\\npitifully, and Libbie could not speak for her own emotion for some time.\\n\\nBut during this silence she put the keystone in the arch of thoughts she\\n\\nhad been building up for many days; and when Margaret was again calm in\\n\\nher sorrow, Libbie said, \"Mrs. Hall, I should like--would you like me to\\n\\ncome for to live here altogether?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMargaret Hall looked up with a sudden light in her countenance, which\\n\\nencouraged Libbie to go on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I could sleep with you, and pay half, you know; and we should be together\\n\\nin the evenings; and her as was home first would watch for the other,\\n\\nand\" (dropping her voice) \"we could talk of him at nights, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was going on, but Mrs. Hall interrupted her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Libbie Marsh! and can you really think of coming to live wi\\' me. I\\n\\nshould like it above--but no! it must not be; you\\'ve no notion on what a\\n\\ncreature I am, at times; more like a mad one when I\\'m in a rage, and I\\n\\ncannot keep it down. I seem to get out of bed wrong side in the morning,\\n\\nand I must have my passion out with the first person I meet. Why, Libbie,\"\\n\\nsaid she, with a doleful look of agony on her face, \"I even used to fly\\n\\nout on him, poor sick lad as he was, and you may judge how little you\\n\\ncan keep it down frae that. No, you must not come. I must live alone\\n\\nnow,\" sinking her voice into the low tones of despair.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Libbie\\'s resolution was brave and strong. \"I\\'m not afraid,\" said\\n\\nshe, smiling. \"I know you better than you know yourself, Mrs. Hall. I\\'ve\\n\\nseen you try of late to keep it down, when you\\'ve been boiling over, and\\n\\nI think you\\'ll go on a-doing so. And at any rate, when you\\'ve had your\\n\\nfit out, you\\'re very kind, and I can forget if you\\'ve been a bit put\\n\\nout. But I\\'ll try not to put you out. Do let me come: I think _he_ would\\n\\nlike us to keep together. I\\'ll do my very best to make you comfortable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s me! it\\'s me as will be making your life miserable with my temper;\\n\\nor else, God knows, how my heart clings to you. You and me is folk\\n\\nalone in the world, for we both loved one who is dead, and who had none\\n\\nelse to love him. If you will live with me, Libbie, I\\'ll try as I never\\n\\ndid afore to be gentle and quiet-tempered. Oh! will you try me, Libbie\\n\\nMarsh?\" So out of the little grave there sprang a hope and a resolution,\\n\\nwhich made life an object to each of the two.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth Marsh returned home the next evening from her day\\'s\\n\\nlabours, Anne (Dixon no longer) crossed over, all in her bridal finery,\\n\\nto endeavour to induce her to join the dance going on in her father\\'s\\n\\nhouse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Anne, this is good of you, a-thinking of me to-night,\" said\\n\\nLibbie, kissing her, \"and though I cannot come,--I\\'ve promised Mrs. Hall\\n\\nto be with her,--I shall think on you, and I trust you\\'ll be happy. I\\n\\nhave got a little needle-case I have looked out for you; stay, here it\\n\\nis,--I wish it were more--only----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only, I know what. You\\'ve been a-spending all your money in nice\\n\\nthings for poor Franky. Thou\\'rt a real good un, Libbie, and I\\'ll keep\\n\\nyour needle-book to my dying day, that I will.\" Seeing Anne in such a\\n\\nfriendly mood, emboldened Libbie to tell her of her change of place; of\\n\\nher intention of lodging henceforward with Margaret Hall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou never will! Why father and mother are as fond of thee as can be;\\n\\nthey\\'ll lower thy rent if that\\'s what it is--and thou knowst they never\\n\\ngrudge thee bit or drop. And Margaret Hall, of all folk, to lodge wi\\'!\\n\\nShe\\'s such a Tartar! Sooner than not have a quarrel, she\\'d fight right\\n\\nhand against left. Thou\\'lt have no peace of thy life. What on earth can\\n\\nmake you think of such a thing, Libbie Marsh?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'ll be so lonely without me,\" pleaded Libbie. \"I\\'m sure I could make\\n\\nher happier, even if she did scold me a bit now and then, than she\\'d be\\n\\na living alone, and I\\'m not afraid of her; and I mean to do my best not\\n\\nto vex her: and it will ease her heart, maybe, to talk to me at times\\n\\nabout Franky. I shall often see your father and mother, and I shall\\n\\nalways thank them for their kindness to me. But they have you and little\\n\\nMary, and poor Mrs. Hall has no one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnne could only repeat, \"Well, I never!\" and hurry off to tell the news\\n\\nat home.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Libbie was right. Margaret Hall is a different woman to the scold\\n\\nof the neighbourhood she once was; touched and softened by the two\\n\\npurifying angels, Sorrow and Love. And it is beautiful to see her\\n\\naffection, her reverence, for Libbie Marsh. Her dead mother could hardly\\n\\nhave cared for her more tenderly than does the hard-hearted washerwoman,\\n\\nnot long ago so fierce and unwomanly. Libbie, herself, has such peace\\n\\nshining on her countenance, as almost makes it beautiful, as she tenders\\n\\nthe services of a daughter to Franky\\'s mother, no longer the desolate\\n\\nlonely orphan, a stranger on the earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you ever read the moral, concluding sentence of a story? I never do,\\n\\nbut I once (in the year 1811, I think) heard of a deaf old lady, living\\n\\nby herself, who did; and as she may have left some descendants with\\n\\nthe same amiable peculiarity, I will put in, for their benefit, what I\\n\\nbelieve to be the secret of Libbie\\'s peace of mind, the real reason why\\n\\nshe no longer feels oppressed at her own loneliness in the world,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe has a purpose in life; and that purpose is a holy one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRISTMAS STORMS AND SUNSHINE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the town of ---- (no matter where) there circulated two local\\n\\nnewspapers (no matter when). Now the _Flying Post_ was long established\\n\\nand respectable--alias bigoted and Tory; the _Examiner_ was spirited\\n\\nand intelligent--alias new-fangled and democratic. Every week these\\n\\nnewspapers contained articles abusing each other; as cross and peppery\\n\\nas articles could be, and evidently the production of irritated minds,\\n\\nalthough they seemed to have one stereotyped commencement,--\"Though\\n\\nthe article appearing in last week\\'s _Post_ (or _Examiner_) is below\\n\\ncontempt, yet we have been induced,\" &c., &c., and every Saturday the\\n\\nRadical shopkeepers shook hands together, and agreed that the _Post_ was\\n\\ndone for, by the slashing, clever _Examiner_; while the more dignified\\n\\nTories began by regretting that Johnson should think that low paper,\\n\\nonly read by a few of the vulgar, worth wasting his wit upon; however\\n\\nthe _Examiner_ was at its last gasp.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not though. It lived and flourished; at least it paid its way, as\\n\\none of the heroes of my story could tell. He was chief compositor, or\\n\\nwhatever title may be given to the head-man of the mechanical part of a\\n\\nnewspaper. He hardly confined himself to that department. Once or twice,\\n\\nunknown to the editor, when the manuscript had fallen short, he had\\n\\nfilled up the vacant space by compositions of his own; announcements of\\n\\na forthcoming crop of green peas in December; a grey thrush having been\\n\\nseen, or a white hare, or such interesting phenomena; invented for the\\n\\noccasion, I must confess; but what of that? His wife always knew when to\\n\\nexpect a little specimen of her husband\\'s literary talent by a peculiar\\n\\ncough, which served as prelude; and, judging from this encouraging sign,\\n\\nand the high-pitched and emphatic voice in which he read them, she was\\n\\ninclined to think, that an \"Ode to an early Rose-bud,\" in the corner\\n\\ndevoted to original poetry, and a letter in the correspondence department,\\n\\nsigned \"Pro Bono Publico,\" were her husband\\'s writing, and to hold up\\n\\nher head accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI never could find out what it was that occasioned the Hodgsons to lodge\\n\\nin the same house as the Jenkinses. Jenkins held the same office in\\n\\nthe Tory paper as Hodgson did in the _Examiner_, and, as I said before,\\n\\nI leave you to give it a name. But Jenkins had a proper sense of his\\n\\nposition, and a proper reverence for all in authority, from the king\\n\\ndown to the editor and sub-editor. He would as soon have thought of\\n\\nborrowing the king\\'s crown for a nightcap, or the king\\'s sceptre for a\\n\\nwalking-stick, as he would have thought of filling up any spare corner\\n\\nwith any production of his own; and I think it would have even added\\n\\nto his contempt of Hodgson (if that were possible), had he known of\\n\\nthe \"productions of his brain,\" as the latter fondly alluded to the\\n\\nparagraphs he inserted, when speaking to his wife.\\n\\n\\n\\nJenkins had his wife too. Wives were wanting to finish the completeness\\n\\nof the quarrel, which existed one memorable Christmas week, some dozen\\n\\nyears ago, between the two neighbours, the two compositors. And with\\n\\nwives, it was a very pretty, a very complete quarrel. To make the\\n\\nopposing parties still more equal, still more well-matched, if the\\n\\nHodgsons had a baby (\"such a baby!--a poor, puny little thing\"), Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins had a cat (\"such a cat! a great, nasty, miowling tom-cat, that\\n\\nwas always stealing the milk put by for little Angel\\'s supper\"). And\\n\\nnow, having matched Greek with Greek, I must proceed to the tug of war.\\n\\nIt was the day before Christmas; such a cold east wind! such an inky\\n\\nsky! such a blue-black look in people\\'s faces, as they were driven out\\n\\nmore than usual, to complete their purchases for the next day\\'s\\n\\nfestival.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore leaving home that morning, Jenkins had given some money to his\\n\\nwife to buy the next day\\'s dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My dear, I wish for turkey and sausages. It may be a weakness, but I\\n\\nown I am partial to sausages. My deceased mother was. Such tastes are\\n\\nhereditary. As to the sweets--whether plum-pudding or mince-pies--I\\n\\nleave such considerations to you; I only beg you not to mind expense.\\n\\nChristmas comes but once a year.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd again he had called out from the bottom of the first flight of\\n\\nstairs, just close to the Hodgsons\\' door (\"such ostentatiousness,\" as\\n\\nMrs. Hodgson observed), \"You will not forget the sausages, my dear?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should have liked to have had something above common, Mary,\" said\\n\\nHodgson, as they too made their plans for the next day, \"but I think\\n\\nroast beef must do for us. You see, love, we\\'ve a family.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only one, Jem! I don\\'t want more than roast beef, though, I\\'m sure.\\n\\nBefore I went to service, mother and me would have thought roast beef\\n\\na very fine dinner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s settle it then, roast beef and a plum-pudding; and now,\\n\\ngood-by. Mind and take care of little Tom. I thought he was a bit hoarse\\n\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd off he went to his work.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, it was a good while since Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Hodgson had spoken\\n\\nto each other, although they were quite as much in possession of the\\n\\nknowledge of events and opinions as though they did. Mary knew that Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins despised her for not having a real lace cap, which Mrs. Jenkins\\n\\nhad; and for having been a servant, which Mrs. Jenkins had not; and the\\n\\nlittle occasional pinchings which the Hodgsons were obliged to resort\\n\\nto, to make both ends meet, would have been very patiently endured by\\n\\nMary, if she had not winced under Mrs. Jenkins\\'s knowledge of such\\n\\neconomy. But she had her revenge. She had a child, and Mrs. Jenkins had\\n\\nnone. To have had a child, even such a puny baby as little Tom, Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins would have worn commonest caps, and cleaned grates, and drudged\\n\\nher fingers to the bone. The great unspoken disappointment of her life\\n\\nsoured her temper, and turned her thoughts inward, and made her morbid\\n\\nand selfish.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hang that cat! he\\'s been stealing again! he\\'s gnawed the cold mutton in\\n\\nhis nasty mouth till it\\'s not fit to set before a Christian; and I\\'ve\\n\\nnothing else for Jem\\'s dinner. But I\\'ll give it him now I\\'ve caught him,\\n\\nthat I will!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo saying, Mary Hodgson caught up her husband\\'s Sunday cane, and despite\\n\\npussy\\'s cries and scratches, she gave him such a beating as she hoped\\n\\nmight cure him of his thievish propensities; when lo! and behold, Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins stood at the door with a face of bitter wrath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you ashamed of yourself, ma\\'am, to abuse a poor dumb animal,\\n\\nma\\'am, as knows no better than to take food when he sees it, ma\\'am? He\\n\\nonly follows the nature which God has given, ma\\'am; and it\\'s a pity your\\n\\nnature, ma\\'am, which I\\'ve heard, is of the stingy saving species, does\\n\\nnot make you shut your cupboard-door a little closer. There is such a\\n\\nthing as law for brute animals. I\\'ll ask Mr. Jenkins, but I don\\'t think\\n\\nthem Radicals has done away with that law yet, for all their Reform\\n\\nBill, ma\\'am. My poor precious love of a Tommy, is he hurt? and is his\\n\\nleg broke for taking a mouthful of scraps, as most people would give\\n\\naway to a beggar,--if he\\'d take \\'em?\" wound up Mrs. Jenkins, casting a\\n\\ncontemptuous look on the remnant of a scrag end of mutton.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary felt very angry and very guilty. For she really pitied the poor\\n\\nlimping animal as he crept up to his mistress, and there lay down to\\n\\nbemoan himself; she wished she had not beaten him so hard, for it\\n\\ncertainly was her own careless way of never shutting the cupboard-door\\n\\nthat had tempted him to his fault. But the sneer at her little bit of\\n\\nmutton turned her penitence to fresh wrath, and she shut the door in\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins\\'s face, as she stood caressing her cat in the lobby, with\\n\\nsuch a bang, that it wakened little Tom, and he began to cry.\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything was to go wrong with Mary to-day. Now baby was awake, who was\\n\\nto take her husband\\'s dinner to the office? She took the child in her\\n\\narms, and tried to hush him off to sleep again, and as she sung she\\n\\ncried, she could hardly tell why,--a sort of reaction from her violent\\n\\nangry feelings. She wished she had never beaten the poor cat; she wondered\\n\\nif his leg was really broken. What would her mother say if she knew how\\n\\ncross and cruel her little Mary was getting? If she should live to beat\\n\\nher child in one of her angry fits?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was of no use lullabying while she sobbed so; it must be given up,\\n\\nand she must just carry her baby in her arms, and take him with her to\\n\\nthe office, for it was long past dinner-time. So she pared the mutton\\n\\ncarefully, although by so doing she reduced the meat to an infinitesimal\\n\\nquantity, and taking the baked potatoes out of the oven, she popped them\\n\\npiping hot into her basket with the et-cteras of plate, butter, salt,\\n\\nand knife and fork.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a bitter wind. She bent against it as she ran, and the\\n\\nflakes of snow were sharp and cutting as ice. Baby cried all the way,\\n\\nthough she cuddled him up in her shawl. Then her husband had made his\\n\\nappetite up for a potato pie, and (literary man as he was) his body got\\n\\nso much the better of his mind, that he looked rather black at the cold\\n\\nmutton. Mary had no appetite for her own dinner when she arrived at\\n\\nhome again. So, after she had tried to feed baby, and he had fretfully\\n\\nrefused to take his bread and milk, she laid him down as usual on his\\n\\nquilt, surrounded by playthings, while she sided away, and chopped\\n\\nsuet for the next day\\'s pudding. Early in the afternoon a parcel came,\\n\\ndone up first in brown paper, then in such a white, grass-bleached,\\n\\nsweet-smelling towel, and a note from her dear, dear mother; in which\\n\\nquaint writing she endeavoured to tell her daughter that she was not\\n\\nforgotten at Christmas time; but that learning that Farmer Burton was\\n\\nkilling his pig, she had made interest for some of his famous pork, out\\n\\nof which she had manufactured some sausages, and flavoured them just as\\n\\nMary used to like when she lived at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dear, dear mother!\" said Mary to herself. \"There never was any one like\\n\\nher for remembering other folk. What rare sausages she used to make!\\n\\nHome things have a smack with \\'em, no bought things can ever have. Set\\n\\nthem up with their sausages! I\\'ve a notion if Mrs. Jenkins had ever\\n\\ntasted mother\\'s she\\'d have no fancy for them town-made things Fanny took\\n\\nin just now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so she went on thinking about home, till the smiles and the dimples\\n\\ncame out again at the remembrance of that pretty cottage, which would\\n\\nlook green even now in the depth of winter, with its pyracanthus, and\\n\\nits holly-bushes, and the great Portugal laurel that was her mother\\'s\\n\\npride. And the back path through the orchard to Farmer Burton\\'s; how\\n\\nwell she remembered it. The bushels of unripe apples she had picked up\\n\\nthere, and distributed among his pigs, till he had scolded her for\\n\\ngiving them so much green trash.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was interrupted--her baby (I call him a baby, because his father and\\n\\nmother did, and because he was so little of his age, but I rather think\\n\\nhe was eighteen months old,) had fallen asleep some time before among\\n\\nhis playthings; an uneasy, restless sleep; but of which Mary had been\\n\\nthankful, as his morning\\'s nap had been too short, and as she was so\\n\\nbusy. But now he began to make such a strange crowing noise, just like\\n\\na chair drawn heavily and gratingly along a kitchen-floor! His eyes was\\n\\nopen, but expressive of nothing but pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother\\'s darling!\" said Mary, in terror, lifting him up. \"Baby, try not\\n\\nto make that noise. Hush, hush, darling; what hurts him?\" But the noise\\n\\ncame worse and worse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fanny! Fanny!\" Mary called in mortal fright, for her baby was almost\\n\\nblack with his gasping breath, and she had no one to ask for aid\\n\\nor sympathy but her landlady\\'s daughter, a little girl of twelve or\\n\\nthirteen, who attended to the house in her mother\\'s absence, as daily\\n\\ncook in gentlemen\\'s families. Fanny was more especially considered the\\n\\nattendant of the upstairs lodgers (who paid for the use of the kitchin,\\n\\n\"for Jenkins could not abide the smell of meat cooking\"), but just now\\n\\nshe was fortunately sitting at her afternoon\\'s work of darning\\n\\nstockings, and hearing Mrs. Hodgson\\'s cry of terror, she ran to her\\n\\nsitting-room, and understood the case at a glance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s got the croup! Oh, Mrs. Hodgson, he\\'ll die as sure as fate. Little\\n\\nbrother had it, and he died in no time. The doctor said he could do\\n\\nnothing for him--it had gone too far. He said if we\\'d put him in a warm\\n\\nbath at first, it might have saved him; but, bless you! he was never\\n\\nhalf so bad as your baby.\" Unconsciously there mingled in her statement\\n\\nsome of a child\\'s love of producing an effect; but the increasing\\n\\ndanger was clear enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, my baby! my baby! Oh, love, love! don\\'t look so ill; I cannot\\n\\nbear it. And my fire so low! There, I was thinking of home, and picking\\n\\ncurrants, and never minding the fire. Oh, Fanny! what is the fire like\\n\\nin the kitchen? Speak.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother told me to screw it up, and throw some slack on as soon as Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins had done with it, and so I did. It\\'s very low and black. But,\\n\\noh, Mrs. Hodgson! let me run for the doctor--I cannot abear to hear him,\\n\\nit\\'s so like little brother.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough her streaming tears Mary motioned her to go; and trembling,\\n\\nsinking, sick at heart, she laid her boy in his cradle, and ran to fill\\n\\nher kettle.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins, having cooked her husband\\'s snug little dinner, to which\\n\\nhe came home; having told him her story of pussy\\'s beating, at which he\\n\\nwas justly and dignifiedly indignant, saying it was all of a piece with\\n\\nthat abusive _Examiner_; having received the sausages, and turkey, and\\n\\nmince pies, which her husband had ordered; and cleaned up the room, and\\n\\nprepared everything for tea, and coaxed and duly bemoaned her cat (who\\n\\nhad pretty nearly forgotten his beating, but very much enjoyed the\\n\\npetting), having done all these and many other things, Mrs. Jenkins sate\\n\\ndown to get up the real lace cap. Every thread was pulled out\\n\\nseparately, and carefully stretched: when, what was that? Outside, in\\n\\nthe street, a chorus of piping children\\'s voices sang the old carol she\\n\\nhad heard a hundred times in the days of her youth:--\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"As Joseph was a walking he heard an angel sing,\\n\\n  \\'This night shall be born our heavenly King.\\n\\n  He neither shall be born in housen nor in hall,\\n\\n  Nor in the place of Paradise, but in an ox\\'s stall.\\n\\n  He neither shall be clothed in purple nor in pall,\\n\\n  But all in fair linen, as were babies all:\\n\\n  He neither shall be rocked in silver nor in gold,\\n\\n  But in a wooden cradle that rocks on the mould,\\'\" &c.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe got up and went to the window. There, below, stood the group of grey\\n\\nblack little figures, relieved against the snow, which now enveloped\\n\\neverything. \"For old sake\\'s sake,\" as she phrased it, she counted out a\\n\\nhalfpenny apiece for the singers, out of the copper bag, and threw them\\n\\ndown below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe room had become chilly while she had been counting out and throwing\\n\\ndown her money, so she stirred her already glowing fire, and sat down\\n\\nright before it--but not to stretch her lace; like Mary Hodgson, she\\n\\nbegan to think over long-past days, on softening remembrances of the\\n\\ndead and gone, on words long forgotten, on holy stories heard at her\\n\\nmother\\'s knee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot think what\\'s come over me to-night,\" said she, half aloud,\\n\\nrecovering herself by the sound of her own voice from her train of\\n\\nthought--\"My head goes wandering on them old times. I\\'m sure more texts\\n\\nhave come into my head with thinking on my mother within this last half\\n\\nhour, than I\\'ve thought on for years and years. I hope I\\'m not going to\\n\\ndie. Folks say, thinking too much on the dead betokens we\\'re going to\\n\\njoin \\'em; I should be loth to go just yet--such a fine turkey as we\\'ve\\n\\ngot for dinner to-morrow, too!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nKnock, knock, knock, at the door, as fast as knuckles could go. And\\n\\nthen, as if the comer could not wait, the door was opened, and Mary\\n\\nHodgson stood there as white as death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jenkins!--oh, your kettle is boiling, thank God! Let me have the\\n\\nwater for my baby, for the love of God! He\\'s got croup, and is dying!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins turned on her chair with a wooden inflexible look on her\\n\\nface, that (between ourselves) her husband knew and dreaded for all his\\n\\npompous dignity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry I can\\'t oblige you, ma\\'am; my kettle is wanted for my\\n\\nhusband\\'s tea. Don\\'t be afeared, Tommy, Mrs. Hodgson won\\'t venture to\\n\\nintrude herself where she\\'s not desired. You\\'d better send for the\\n\\ndoctor, ma\\'am, instead of wasting your time in wringing your hands,\\n\\nma\\'am--my kettle is engaged.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMary clasped her hands together with passionate force, but spoke no word\\n\\nof entreaty to that wooden face--that sharp, determined voice; but, as\\n\\nshe turned away, she prayed for strength to bear the coming trial, and\\n\\nstrength to forgive Mrs. Jenkins.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins watched her go away meekly, as one who has no hope, and\\n\\nthen she turned upon herself as sharply as she ever did on any one else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a brute I am, Lord forgive me! What\\'s my husband\\'s tea to a baby\\'s\\n\\nlife? In croup, too, where time is everything. You crabbed old vixen,\\n\\nyou!--any one may know you never had a child!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was down stairs (kettle in hand) before she had finished her\\n\\nself-upbraiding; and when in Mrs. Hodgson\\'s room, she rejected all\\n\\nthanks (Mary had not the voice for many words), saying, stiffly, \"I do\\n\\nit for the poor babby\\'s sake, ma\\'am, hoping he may live to have mercy\\n\\nto poor dumb beasts, if he does forget to lock his cupboards.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut she did everything, and more than Mary, with her young inexperience,\\n\\ncould have thought of. She prepared the warm bath, and tried it with her\\n\\nhusband\\'s own thermometer (Mr. Jenkins was as punctual as clockwork in\\n\\nnoting down the temperature of every day). She let his mother place her\\n\\nbaby in the tub, still preserving the same rigid, affronted aspect, and\\n\\nthen she went upstairs without a word. Mary longed to ask her to stay,\\n\\nbut dared not; though, when she left the room, the tears chased each\\n\\nother down her cheeks faster than ever. Poor young mother! how she\\n\\ncounted the minutes till the doctor should come. But, before he came,\\n\\ndown again stalked Mrs. Jenkins, with something in her hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen many of these croup-fits, which, I take it, you\\'ve not, ma\\'am.\\n\\nMustard plaisters is very sovereign, put on the throat; I\\'ve been up and\\n\\nmade one, ma\\'am, and, by your leave, I\\'ll put it on the poor little\\n\\nfellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMary could not speak, but she signed her grateful assent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt began to smart while they still kept silence; and he looked up to his\\n\\nmother as if seeking courage from her looks to bear the stinging pain;\\n\\nbut she was softly crying, to see him suffer, and her want of courage\\n\\nreacted upon him, and he began to sob aloud. Instantly Mrs. Jenkins\\'s\\n\\napron was up, hiding her face: \"Peep-bo, baby,\" said she, as merrily\\n\\nas she could. His little face brightened, and his mother having once\\n\\ngot the cue, the two women kept the little fellow amused, until his\\n\\nplaister had taken effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s better,--oh, Mrs. Jenkins, look at his eyes! how different! And he\\n\\nbreathes quite softly----\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mary spoke thus, the doctor entered. He examined his patient. Baby\\n\\nwas really better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It has been a sharp attack, but the remedies you have applied have been\\n\\nworth all the Pharmacopoeia an hour later.--I shall send a powder,\" &c.\\n\\n&c.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins stayed to hear this opinion; and (her heart wonderfully\\n\\nmore easy) was going to leave the room, when Mary seized her hand and\\n\\nkissed it; she could not speak her gratitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jenkins looked affronted and awkward, and as if she must go\\n\\nupstairs and wash her hand directly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, in spite of these sour looks, she came softly down an hour or so\\n\\nafterwards to see how baby was.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little gentleman slept well after the fright he had given his\\n\\nfriends; and on Christmas morning, when Mary awoke and looked at the\\n\\nsweet little pale face lying on her arm, she could hardly realize the\\n\\ndanger he had been in.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she came down (later than usual), she found the household in a\\n\\ncommotion. What do you think had happened? Why, pussy had been a traitor\\n\\nto his best friend, and eaten up some of Mr. Jenkins\\'s own especial\\n\\nsausages; and gnawed and tumbled the rest so, that they were not fit to\\n\\nbe eaten! There were no bounds to that cat\\'s appetite! he would have\\n\\neaten his own father if he had been tender enough. And now Mrs. Jenkins\\n\\nstormed and cried--\"Hang the cat!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChristmas Day, too! and all the shops shut! \"What was turkey without\\n\\nsausages?\" gruffly asked Mr. Jenkins.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Jem!\" whispered Mary, \"hearken what a piece of work he\\'s making\\n\\nabout sausages,--I should like to take Mrs. Jenkins up some of mother\\'s;\\n\\nthey\\'re twice as good as bought sausages.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I see no objection, my dear. Sausages do not involve intimacies, else\\n\\nhis politics are what I can no ways respect.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But, oh, Jem, if you had seen her last night about baby! I\\'m sure\\n\\nshe may scold me for ever, and I\\'ll not answer. I\\'d even make her cat\\n\\nwelcome to the sausages.\" The tears gathered to Mary\\'s eyes as she\\n\\nkissed her boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better take \\'em upstairs, my dear, and give them to the cat\\'s\\n\\nmistress.\" And Jem chuckled at his saying.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary put them on a plate, but still she loitered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What must I say, Jem? I never know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Say--I hope you\\'ll accept of these sausages, as my mother--no, that\\'s\\n\\nnot grammar;--say what comes uppermost, Mary, it will be sure to be\\n\\nright.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Mary carried them upstairs and knocked at the door; and when told to\\n\\n\"come in,\" she looked very red, but went up to Mrs. Jenkins, saying,\\n\\n\"Please take these. Mother made them.\" And was away before an answer\\n\\ncould be given.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as Hodgson was ready to go to church, Mrs. Jenkins came downstairs,\\n\\nand called Fanny. In a minute, the latter entered the Hodgsons\\' room,\\n\\nand delivered Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins\\'s compliments, and they would be\\n\\nparticular glad if Mr. and Mrs. Hodgson would eat their dinner with\\n\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And carry baby upstairs in a shawl, be sure,\" added Mrs. Jenkins\\'s\\n\\nvoice in the passage, close to the door, whither she had followed her\\n\\nmessenger. There was no discussing the matter, with the certainty of\\n\\nevery word being overheard.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary looked anxiously at her husband. She remembered his saying he did\\n\\nnot approve of Mr. Jenkins\\'s politics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think it would do for baby?\" asked he.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered she, eagerly; \"I would wrap him up so warm.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I\\'ve got our room up to sixty-five already, for all it\\'s so\\n\\nfrosty,\" added the voice outside.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, how do you think they settled the matter? The very best way in the\\n\\nworld. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins came down into the Hodgsons\\' room, and dined\\n\\nthere. Turkey at the top, roast beef at the bottom, sausages at one side,\\n\\npotatoes at the other. Second course, plum-pudding at the top, and mince\\n\\npies at the bottom.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd after dinner, Mrs. Jenkins would have baby on her knee; and he\\n\\nseemed quite to take to her; she declared he was admiring the real lace\\n\\non her cap, but Mary thought (though she did not say so) that he was\\n\\npleased by her kind looks and coaxing words. Then he was wrapped up and\\n\\ncarried carefully upstairs to tea, in Mrs. Jenkins\\'s room. And after\\n\\ntea, Mrs. Jenkins, and Mary, and her husband, found out each other\\'s\\n\\nmutual liking for music, and sat singing old glees and catches, till I\\n\\ndon\\'t know what o\\'clock, without one word of politics or newspapers.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore they parted, Mary had coaxed pussy on to her knee; for Mrs.\\n\\nJenkins would not part with baby, who was sleeping on her lap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you\\'re busy, bring him to me. Do, now, it will be a real favour. I\\n\\nknow you must have a deal to do, with another coming; let him come up to\\n\\nme. I\\'ll take the greatest of cares of him; pretty darling, how sweet he\\n\\nlooks when he\\'s asleep!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the couples were once more alone, the husbands unburdened their\\n\\nminds to their wives.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Jenkins said to his--\"Do you know, Burgess tried to make me believe\\n\\nHodgson was such a fool as to put paragraphs into the _Examiner_ now and\\n\\nthen; but I see he knows his place, and has got too much sense to do any\\n\\nsuch thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHodgson said--\"Mary, love, I almost fancy from Jenkins\\'s way of speaking\\n\\n(so much civiler than I expected), he guesses I wrote that \\'Pro Bono\\'\\n\\nand the \\'Rose-bud,\\'--at any rate, I\\'ve no objection to your naming it,\\n\\nif the subject should come uppermost; I should like him to know I\\'m a\\n\\nliterary man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWell! I\\'ve ended my tale; I hope you don\\'t think it too long; but, before\\n\\nI go, just let me say one thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf any of you have any quarrels, or misunderstandings, or coolnesses, or\\n\\ncold shoulders, or shynesses, or tiffs, or miffs, or huffs, with any one\\n\\nelse, just make friends before Christmas,--you will be so much merrier\\n\\nif you do.\\n\\n\\n\\nI ask it of you for the sake of that old angelic song, heard so many\\n\\nyears ago by the shepherds, keeping watch by night, on Bethlehem\\n\\nHeights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHAND AND HEART.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother, I should so like to have a great deal of money,\" said little\\n\\nTom Fletcher one evening, as he sat on a low stool by his mother\\'s knee.\\n\\nHis mother was knitting busily by the firelight, and they had both been\\n\\nsilent for some time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What would you do with a great deal of money if you had it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know--I would do a great many things. But should not you\\n\\nlike to have a great deal of money, mother?\" persisted he.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps I should,\" answered Mrs. Fletcher. \"I am like you sometimes,\\n\\ndear, and think that I should be very glad of a little more money. But\\n\\nthen I don\\'t think I am like you in one thing, for I have always some\\n\\nlittle plan in my mind, for which I should want the money. I never wish\\n\\nfor it just for its own sake.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, mother! there are so many things we could do if we had but\\n\\nmoney;--real good, wise things I mean.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And if we have real good, wise things in our head to do, which cannot\\n\\nbe done without money, I can quite enter into the wish for money. But\\n\\nyou know, my little boy, you did not tell me of any good or wise\\n\\nthing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No! I believe I was not thinking of good or wise things just then, but\\n\\nonly how much I should like money to do what I liked,\" answered little\\n\\nTom ingenuously, looking up in his mother\\'s face. She smiled down upon\\n\\nhim, and stroked his head. He knew she was pleased with him for having\\n\\ntold her openly what was passing in his mind. Presently he began again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother, if you wanted to do something very good and wise, and if you\\n\\ncould not do it without money, what should you do?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There are two ways of obtaining money for such wants; one is by earning;\\n\\nand the other is by saving. Now both are good, because both imply\\n\\nself-denial. Do you understand me, Tom? If you have to earn money, you\\n\\nmust steadily go on doing what you do not like perhaps; such as working\\n\\nwhen you would like to be playing, or in bed, or sitting talking with me\\n\\nover the fire. You deny yourself these little pleasures; and that is\\n\\na good habit in itself, to say nothing of the industry and energy you\\n\\nhave to exert in working. If you save money, you can easily see how you\\n\\nexercise self-denial. You do without something you wish for in order to\\n\\npossess the money it would have cost. Inasmuch as self-denial, energy,\\n\\nand industry are all good things, you do well either to earn or to save.\\n\\nBut you see the purpose for which you want the money must be taken into\\n\\nconsideration. You say, for \\'something wise and good.\\' Either earning or\\n\\nsaving becomes holy in this case. I must then think which will be most\\n\\nconsistent with my other duties, before I decide whether I will earn or\\n\\nsave money.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite know what you mean, mother.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will try and explain myself. You know I have to keep a little shop,\\n\\nand to try and get employment in knitting stockings, and to clean my\\n\\nhouse, and to mend our clothes, and many other things. Now, do you think\\n\\nI should be doing my duty if I left you in the evenings, when you come\\n\\nhome from school, to go out as a waiter at ladies\\' parties? I could earn\\n\\na good deal of money by it, and I could spend it well among those who\\n\\nare poorer than I am (such as lame Harry), but then I should be leaving\\n\\nyou alone in the little time that we have to be together; I do not think\\n\\nI should be doing right even for our \\'good and wise purpose\\' to earn\\n\\nmoney, if it took me away from you at nights: do you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, indeed; you never mean to do it, do you, mother?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said she, smiling; \"at any rate not till you are older. You see at\\n\\npresent then, I cannot _earn_ money, if I want a little more than usual\\n\\nto help a sick neighbour. I must then try and _save_ money. Nearly every\\n\\none can do that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can _we_, mother? We are so careful of everything. Ned Dixon calls us\\n\\nstingy: what could _we save_?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, many and many a little thing. We use many things which are\\n\\nluxuries; which we do not want, but only use them for pleasure. Tea and\\n\\nsugar--butter--our Sunday\\'s dinner of bacon or meat--the grey ribbon I\\n\\nbought for my bonnet, because you thought it prettier than the black,\\n\\nwhich was cheaper; all these are luxuries. We use very little tea or\\n\\nsugar, it is true; but we might do without any.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You did do without any, mother, for a long, long time, you know, to\\n\\nhelp widow Black; it was only for your bad head-aches.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! but you see we can save money; a penny, a halfpenny a day, or\\n\\neven a penny a week, would in time make a little store ready to be\\n\\napplied to the \\'good and wise\\' purpose, when the time comes. But do you\\n\\nknow, my little boy, I think we may be considering money too much as the\\n\\nonly thing required if we want to do a kindness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it is not the only thing, it is the chief thing, at any rate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, love, it is not the chief thing. I should think very poorly of that\\n\\nbeggar who liked sixpence given with a curse (as I have sometimes heard\\n\\nit), better than the kind and gentle words some people use in refusing\\n\\nto give. The curse sinks deep into the heart; or if it does not, it\\n\\nis a proof that the poor creature has been made hard before by harsh\\n\\ntreatment. And mere money can do little to cheer a sore heart. It is\\n\\nkindness only that can do this. Now we have all of us kindness in our\\n\\npower. The little child of two years old, who can only just totter\\n\\nabout, can show kindness?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can I, mother?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure, dear; and you often do, only perhaps not quite so often as\\n\\nyou might do. Neither do I. But instead of wishing for money (of which I\\n\\ndon\\'t think either you or I are ever likely to have much), suppose you\\n\\ntry to-morrow how you can make people happier, by thinking of little\\n\\nloving actions of help. Let us try and take for our text, \\'Silver and\\n\\ngold I have none, but such as I have give I unto thee.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ay, mother, we will.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMust I tell you about little Tom\\'s \"to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI do not know if little Tom dreamed of what his mother and he had been\\n\\ntalking about, but I do know that the first thing he thought about, when\\n\\nhe awoke in the morning, was his mother\\'s saying that he might try how\\n\\nmany kind actions he could do that day without money; and he was so\\n\\nimpatient to begin, that he jumped up and dressed himself, although\\n\\nit was more than an hour before his usual time of getting up. All the\\n\\ntime he kept wondering what a little boy like him, only eight years old,\\n\\ncould do for other people; till at last he grew so puzzled with inventing\\n\\noccasions for showing kindness, that he very wisely determined to think\\n\\nno more about it, but learn his lessons very perfectly; that was the\\n\\nfirst thing he had to do; and then he would try, without too much planning\\n\\nbeforehand, to keep himself ready to lend a helping hand, or to give\\n\\na kind word, when the right time came. So he screwed himself into a\\n\\ncorner, out of the way of his mother\\'s sweeping and dusting, and tucked\\n\\nhis feet up on the rail of the chair, turned his face to the wall, and\\n\\nin about half an hour\\'s time, he could turn round with a light heart,\\n\\nfeeling he had learnt his lesson well, and might employ his time as he\\n\\nliked till breakfast was ready. He looked round the room; his mother\\n\\nhad arranged all neatly, and was now gone to the bedroom; but the\\n\\ncoal-scuttle and the can for water were empty, and Tom ran away to fill\\n\\nthem; and as he came back with the latter from the pump, he saw Ann\\n\\nJones (the scold of the neighbourhood) hanging out her clothes on a line\\n\\nstretched across from side to side of the little court, and speaking\\n\\nvery angrily and loudly to her little girl, who was getting into some\\n\\nmischief in the house-place, as her mother perceived through the open\\n\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There never were such plagues as my children are, to be sure,\" said Ann\\n\\nJones, as she went into her house, looking very red and passionate.\\n\\nDirectly after, Tom heard the sound of a slap, and then a little child\\'s\\n\\ncry of pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" thought he, \"if I durst go and offer to nurse and play with\\n\\nlittle Hester. Ann Jones is fearful cross, and just as likely to take me\\n\\nwrong as right; but she won\\'t box me for mother\\'s sake; mother nursed\\n\\nJemmy many a day through the fever, so she won\\'t slap me, I think. Any\\n\\nrate, I\\'ll try.\" But it was with a beating heart he said to the\\n\\nfierce-looking Mrs. Jones, \"Please, may I go and play with Hester. May\\n\\nbe I could keep her quiet while you\\'re busy hanging out clothes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What! and let you go slopping about, I suppose, just when I\\'d made\\n\\nall ready for my master\\'s breakfast. Thank you, but my own children\\'s\\n\\nmischief is as much as I reckon on; I\\'ll have none of strange lads in my\\n\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I did not mean to do mischief or slop,\" said Tom, a little sadly at\\n\\nbeing misunderstood in his good intentions. \"I only wanted to help.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you want to help, lift me up those clothes\\' pegs, and save me\\n\\nstooping; my back\\'s broken with it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom would much rather have gone to play with and amuse little Hester;\\n\\nbut it was true enough that giving Mrs. Jones the clothes\\' pegs as she\\n\\nwanted them would help her as much; and perhaps keep her from being so\\n\\ncross with her children if they did anything to hinder her. Besides,\\n\\nlittle Hester\\'s cry had died away, and she was evidently occupied in\\n\\nsome new pursuit (Tom could only hope that it was not in mischief this\\n\\ntime); so he began to give Ann the pegs as she wanted them, and she,\\n\\nsoothed by his kind help, opened her heart a little to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder how it is your mother has trained you up to be so handy, Tom;\\n\\nyou\\'re as good as a girl--better than many a girl. I don\\'t think Hester\\n\\nin three years\\' time will be as thoughtful as you. There!\" (as a fresh\\n\\nscream reached them from the little ones inside the house), \"they are at\\n\\nsome mischief again; but I\\'ll teach \\'em,\" said she, getting down from\\n\\nher stool in a fresh access of passion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let me go,\" said Tom, in a begging voice, for he dreaded the cruel\\n\\nsound of another slap. \"I\\'ll lift the basket of pegs on to a stool, so\\n\\nthat you need not stoop; and I\\'ll keep the little ones safe out of\\n\\nmischief till you\\'re done. Do let me go, missus.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith some grumblings at losing his help, she let him go into the\\n\\nhouse-place. He found Hester, a little girl of five, and two younger ones.\\n\\nThey had been fighting for a knife, and in the struggle, the second,\\n\\nJohnnie, had cut his finger--not very badly, but he was frightened at\\n\\nthe sight of the blood; and Hester, who might have helped, and who was\\n\\nreally sorry, stood sullenly aloof, dreading the scolding her mother\\n\\nalways gave her if either of the little ones hurt themselves while under\\n\\nher care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hester,\" said Tom, \"will you get me some cold water, please? it will\\n\\nstop the bleeding better than anything. I daresay you can find me a\\n\\nbasin to hold it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHester trotted off, pleased at Tom\\'s confidence in her power. When the\\n\\nbleeding was partly stopped, he asked her to find him a bit of rag, and\\n\\nshe scrambled under the dresser for a little piece she had hidden there\\n\\nthe day before. Meanwhile, Johnny ceased crying, he was so interested in\\n\\nall the preparation for dressing his little wound, and so much pleased\\n\\nto find himself an object of so much attention and consequence. The\\n\\nbaby, too, sat on the floor, gravely wondering at the commotion; and\\n\\nthus busily occupied, they were quiet and out of mischief till Ann Jones\\n\\ncame in, and, having hung out her clothes, and finished that morning\\'s\\n\\npiece of work, she was ready to attend to her children in her rough,\\n\\nhasty kind of way.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration p. 220: The Cut Finger.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! I\\'m sure, Tom, you\\'ve tied it up as neatly as I could have done.\\n\\nI wish I\\'d always such an one as you to see after the children; but you\\n\\nmust run off now, lad, your mother was calling you as I came in, and I\\n\\nsaid I\\'d send you--good-by, and thank you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tom was going away, the baby, sitting in square gravity on the floor,\\n\\nbut somehow conscious of Tom\\'s gentle helpful ways, put up her mouth to\\n\\nbe kissed; and he stooped down in answer to the little gesture, feeling\\n\\nvery happy, and very full of love and kindliness.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter breakfast, his mother told him it was school time, and he must set\\n\\noff, as she did not like him to run in out of breath and flurried, just\\n\\nwhen the schoolmaster was going to begin; but she wished him to come in\\n\\ndecently and in order, with quiet decorum, and thoughtfulness as to what\\n\\nhe was going to do. So Tom got his cap and his bag, and went off with\\n\\na light heart, which I suppose made his footsteps light, for he found\\n\\nhimself above half way to school while it wanted yet a quarter to the\\n\\ntime. So he slackened his pace, and looked about him a little more than\\n\\nhe had been doing. There was a little girl on the other side of the\\n\\nstreet carrying a great big basket, and lugging along a little child\\n\\njust able to walk; but who, I suppose, was tired, for he was crying\\n\\npitifully, and sitting down every two or three steps. Tom ran across the\\n\\nstreet, for, as perhaps you have found out, he was very fond of babies,\\n\\nand could not bear to hear them cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Little girl, what is he crying about? Does he want to be carried? I\\'ll\\n\\ntake him up, and carry him as far as I go alongside of you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo saying, Tom was going to suit the action to the word; but the baby\\n\\ndid not choose that any one should carry him but his sister, and refused\\n\\nTom\\'s kindness. Still he could carry the heavy basket of potatoes for\\n\\nthe little girl, which he did as far as their road lay together, when\\n\\nshe thanked him, and bade him good-by, and said she could manage very\\n\\nwell now, her home was so near. So Tom went into school very happy and\\n\\npeaceful; and had a good character to take home to his mother for that\\n\\nmorning\\'s lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt happened that this very day was the weekly half-holiday, so that Tom\\n\\nhad many hours unoccupied that afternoon. Of course, his first\\n\\nemployment after dinner was to learn his lessons for the next day; and\\n\\nthen, when he had put his books away, he began to wonder what he should\\n\\ndo next.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stood lounging against the door wishing all manner of idle wishes;\\n\\na habit he was apt to fall into. He wished he were the little boy\\n\\nwho lived opposite, who had three brothers ready to play with him on\\n\\nhalf-holidays; he wished he were Sam Harrison, whose father had taken\\n\\nhim one day a trip by the railroad; he wished he were the little boy who\\n\\nalways went with the omnibuses,--it must be so pleasant to go riding\\n\\nabout on the step, and to see so many people; he wished he were a\\n\\nsailor, to sail away to the countries where grapes grew wild, and\\n\\nmonkeys and parrots were to be had for the catching. Just as he was\\n\\nwishing himself the little Prince of Wales, to drive about in a\\n\\ngoat-carriage, and wondering if he should not feel very shy with the\\n\\nthree great ostrich-feathers always niddle-noddling on his head, for\\n\\npeople to know him by, his mother came from washing up the dishes, and\\n\\nsaw him deep in the reveries little boys and girls are apt to fall into\\n\\nwhen they are the only children in a house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Tom,\" said she, \"why don\\'t you go out, and make the most of\\n\\nthis fine afternoon?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, mother,\" answered he (suddenly recalled to the fact that he was\\n\\nlittle Tom Fletcher, instead of the Prince of Wales, and consequently\\n\\nfeeling a little bit flat), \"it is so dull going out by myself. I have\\n\\nno one to play with. Can\\'t you go with me, mother--just this once, into\\n\\nthe fields?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor Mrs. Fletcher heartily wished she could gratify this very natural\\n\\ndesire of her little boy; but she had the shop to mind, and many a\\n\\nlittle thing besides to do; it was impossible. But however much she\\n\\nmight regret a thing, she was too faithful to repine. So, after a\\n\\nmoment\\'s thought, she said, cheerfully, \"Go into the fields for a walk,\\n\\nand see how many wild flowers you can bring me home, and I\\'ll get down\\n\\nfather\\'s jug for you to put them in when you come back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But, mother, there are so few pretty flowers near a town,\" said Tom, a\\n\\nlittle unwillingly, for it was a coming down from being Prince of Wales,\\n\\nand he was not yet quite reconciled to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh dear! there are a great many if you\\'ll only look for them. I dare\\n\\nsay you\\'ll make me up as many as twenty different kinds.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you reckon daisies, mother?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure; they are just as pretty as any.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, if you\\'ll reckon such as them, I dare say I can bring you more than\\n\\ntwenty.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo off he ran; his mother watching him till he was out of sight, and\\n\\nthen she returned to her work. In about two hours he came back, his pale\\n\\ncheeks looking quite rosy, and his eyes quite bright. His country walk,\\n\\ntaken with cheerful spirits, had done him all the good his mother\\n\\ndesired, and had restored his usually even, happy temper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look, mother! here are three-and-twenty different kinds; you said I\\n\\nmight count all, so I have even counted this thing like a nettle with\\n\\nlilac flowers, and this little common blue thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Robin-run-in-the-hedge is its name,\" said his mother. \"It\\'s very pretty\\n\\nif you look at it close. One, two, three\"--she counted them all over,\\n\\nand there really were three-and-twenty. She went to reach down the best\\n\\njug.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother,\" said little Tom, \"do you like them very much?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, very much,\" said she, not understanding his meaning. He was\\n\\nsilent, and gave a little sigh. \"Why, my dear?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, only--it does not signify if you like them very much; but I thought\\n\\nhow nice it would be to take them to lame Harry, who can never walk so\\n\\nfar as the fields, and can hardly know what summer is like, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that will be very nice; I am glad you thought of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLame Harry was sitting by himself, very patiently, in a neighbouring\\n\\ncellar. He was supported by his daughter\\'s earnings; but as she worked\\n\\nin a factory, he was much alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the bunch of flowers had looked pretty in the fields, they looked\\n\\nten times as pretty in the cellar to which they were now carried. Lame\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes brightened up with pleasure at the sight; and he began to\\n\\ntalk of the times long ago, when he was a little boy in the country, and\\n\\nhad a corner of his father\\'s garden to call his own, and grow lad\\'s-love\\n\\nand wall-flower in. Little Tom put them in water for him, and put the\\n\\njug on the table by him; on which his daughter had placed the old Bible,\\n\\nworn with much reading, although treated with careful reverence. It was\\n\\nlying open, with Harry\\'s horn spectacles put in to mark the place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I reckon my spectacles are getting worn out; they are not so clear as\\n\\nthey used to be; they are dim-like before my eyes, and it hurts me to\\n\\nread long together,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s a sad miss to me. I never thought\\n\\nthe time long when I could read; but now I keep wearying for the day to\\n\\nbe over, though the nights, when I cannot sleep for my legs paining me,\\n\\nare almost as bad. However, it\\'s the Lord\\'s will.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Would you like me--I cannot read very well aloud, but I\\'d do my best,\\n\\nif you\\'d like me to read a bit to you. I\\'ll just run home and get my\\n\\ntea, and be back directly.\" And off Tom ran.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe found it very pleasant reading aloud to lame Harry, for the old man\\n\\nhad so much to say that was worth listening to, and was so glad of a\\n\\nlistener, that I think there was as much talking as reading done that\\n\\nevening. But the Bible served as a text-book to their conversation;\\n\\nfor in a long life old Harry had seen and heard so much, which he\\n\\nhad connected with events, or promises, or precepts contained in the\\n\\nScriptures, that it was quite curious to find how everything was brought\\n\\nin and dove-tailed, as an illustration of what they were reading.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Tom got up to go away, lame Harry gave him many thanks, and told\\n\\nhim he would not sleep the worse for having made an old man\\'s evening\\n\\nso pleasant. Tom came home in high self-satisfaction. \"Mother,\" said\\n\\nhe, \"it\\'s all very true what you said about the good that may be done\\n\\nwithout money: I\\'ve done many pieces of good to-day without a farthing.\\n\\nFirst,\" said he, taking hold of his little finger, \"I helped Ann Jones\\n\\nwith hanging out her clothes when she was\"--\\n\\n\\n\\nHis mother had been listening while she turned over the pages of the New\\n\\nTestament which lay by her, and now having found what she wanted, she\\n\\nput her arm gently round his waist, and drew him fondly towards her. He\\n\\nsaw her finger put under one passage, and read,--\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was silent in a moment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen his mother spoke in her soft low voice:--\"Dearest Tom, though I\\n\\ndon\\'t want us to talk about it, as if you had been doing more than just\\n\\nwhat you ought, I am glad you have seen the truth of what I said; how\\n\\nfar more may be done by the loving heart than by mere money-giving; and\\n\\nevery one may have the loving heart.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have told you of one day of little Tom\\'s life, when he was eight years\\n\\nold, and lived with his mother. I must now pass over a year, and tell\\n\\nyou of a very different kind of life he had then to lead. His mother had\\n\\nnever been very strong, and had had a good deal of anxiety; at last she\\n\\nwas taken ill, and soon felt that there was no hope for her recovery.\\n\\nFor a long time the thought of leaving her little boy was a great distress\\n\\nto her, and a great trial to her faith. But God strengthened her, and\\n\\nsent his peace into her soul, and before her death she was content to\\n\\nleave her precious child in his hands, who is a Father to the\\n\\nfatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widow.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she felt that she had not many more days to live, she sent for her\\n\\nhusband\\'s brother, who lived in a town not many miles off; and gave her\\n\\nlittle Tom in charge to him to bring up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There are a few pounds in the savings-bank--I don\\'t know how many\\n\\nexactly--and the furniture and bit of stock in the shop; perhaps they\\n\\nwould be enough to bring him up to be a joiner, like his father before\\n\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe spoke feebly, and with many pauses. Her brother-in-law, though a\\n\\nrough kind of man, wished to do all he could to make her feel easy in\\n\\nher last moments, and touched with the reference to his dead brother,\\n\\npromised all she required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take him back with me after\"--the funeral, he was going to say,\\n\\nbut he stopped. She smiled gently, fully understanding his meaning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We shall, may be, not be so tender with him as you\\'ve been; but I\\'ll\\n\\nsee he comes to no harm. It will be a good thing for him to rough it a\\n\\nbit with other children,--he\\'s too nesh for a boy; but I\\'ll pay them if\\n\\nthey aren\\'t kind to him in the long run, never fear.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThough this speech was not exactly what she liked, there was quite\\n\\nenough of good feeling in it to make her thankful for such a protector\\n\\nand friend for her boy. And so, thankful for the joys she had had, and\\n\\nthankful for the sorrows which had taught her meekness, thankful for\\n\\nlife, and thankful for death, she died.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer brother-in-law arranged all as she had wished. After the quiet\\n\\nsimple funeral was over, he took Tom by the hand, and set off on the\\n\\nsix-mile walk to his home. Tom had cried till he could cry no more, but\\n\\nsobs came quivering up from his heart every now and then, as he passed\\n\\nsome well-remembered cottage, or thorn-bush, or tree on the road. His\\n\\nuncle was very sorry for him, but did not know what to say, or how to\\n\\ncomfort him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now mind, lad, thou com\\'st to me if thy cousins are o\\'er hard upon\\n\\nthee. Let me hear if they misuse thee, and I\\'ll give it them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom shrunk from the idea that this gave him of the cousins, whose\\n\\ncompanionship he had, until then, been looking forward to as a pleasure.\\n\\nHe was not reassured when, after threading several streets and by-ways,\\n\\nthey came into a court of dingy-looking houses, and his uncle opened the\\n\\ndoor of one, from which the noise of loud, if not angry voices was\\n\\nheard.\\n\\n\\n\\nA tall large woman was whirling one child out of her way with a rough\\n\\nmovement of her arm; while she was scolding a boy a little older than\\n\\nTom, who stood listening sullenly to her angry words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell father of thee, I will,\" said she; and turning to uncle John,\\n\\nshe began to pour out her complaints against Jack, without taking any\\n\\nnotice of little Tom, who clung to his uncle\\'s hand as to a protector in\\n\\nthe scene of violence into which he had entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, well, wife!--I\\'ll leather Jack the next time I catch him letting\\n\\nthe water out of the pipe; but now get this lad and me some tea, for\\n\\nwe\\'re weary and tired.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis aunt seemed to wish Jack might be leathered now, and to be angry\\n\\nwith her husband for not revenging her injuries; for an injury it was\\n\\nthat the boy had done her in letting the water all run off, and that on\\n\\nthe very eve of the washing day. The mother grumbled as she left off\\n\\nmopping the wet floor, and went to the fire to stir it up ready for the\\n\\nkettle, without a word of greeting to her little nephew, or of welcome\\n\\nto her husband. On the contrary, she complained of the trouble of getting\\n\\ntea ready afresh, just when she had put slack on the fire, and had no\\n\\nwater in the house to fill the kettle with. Her husband grew angry, and\\n\\nTom was frightened to hear his uncle speaking sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If I can\\'t have a cup of tea in my own house without all this ado, I\\'ll\\n\\ngo to the Spread Eagle, and take Tom with me. They\\'ve a bright fire\\n\\nthere at all times, choose how they manage it; and no scolding wives.\\n\\nCome, Tom, let\\'s be off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJack had been trying to scrape acquaintance with his cousin by winks and\\n\\ngrimaces behind his mother\\'s back, and now made a sign of drinking out\\n\\nof an imaginary glass. But Tom clung to his uncle, and softly pulled him\\n\\ndown again on his chair, from which he had risen to go to the\\n\\npublic-house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you please, ma\\'am,\" said he, sadly frightened of his aunt, \"I think\\n\\nI could find the pump, if you\\'d let me try.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe muttered something like an acquiescence; so Tom took up the kettle,\\n\\nand, tired as he was, went out to the pump. Jack, who had done nothing\\n\\nbut mischief all day, stood amazed, but at last settled that his cousin\\n\\nwas a \"softy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Tom came back, he tried to blow the fire with the broken bellows,\\n\\nand at last the water boiled, and the tea was made. \"Thou\\'rt a rare lad,\\n\\nTom,\" said his uncle. \"I wonder when our Jack will be of as much use.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis comparison did not please either Jack or his mother, who liked to\\n\\nkeep to herself the privilege of directing their father\\'s dissatisfaction\\n\\nwith his children. Tom felt their want of kindliness towards him; and\\n\\nnow that he had nothing to do but rest and eat, he began to feel very\\n\\nsad, and his eyes kept filling with tears, which he brushed away with\\n\\nthe back of his hand, not wishing to have them seen. But his uncle\\n\\nnoticed him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thou had\\'st better have had a glass at the Spread Eagle,\" said he,\\n\\ncompassionately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; I only am rather tired. May I go to bed?\" said he, longing for a\\n\\ngood cry unobserved under the bed-clothes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s he to sleep?\" asked the husband of the wife.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said she, still offended on Jack\\'s account, \"that\\'s thy look-out.\\n\\nHe\\'s thy flesh and blood, not mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come, wife,\" said uncle John, \"he\\'s an orphan, poor chap. An orphan is\\n\\nkin to every one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was softened directly, for she had much kindness in her, although\\n\\nthis evening she had been so much put out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no place for him but with Jack and Dick. We\\'ve the baby, and\\n\\nthe other three are packed close enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe took Tom up to the little back room, and stopped to talk with him\\n\\nfor a minute or two, for her husband\\'s words had smitten her heart, and\\n\\nshe was sorry for the ungracious reception she had given Tom at first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Jack and Dick are never in bed till we come, and it\\'s work enough to\\n\\ncatch them then on fine evenings,\" said she, as she took the candle\\n\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom tried to speak to God as his mother had taught him, out of the\\n\\nfulness of his little heart, which was heavy enough that night. He tried\\n\\nto think how she would have wished him to speak and to do, and when he\\n\\nfelt puzzled with the remembrance of the scene of disorder and anger\\n\\nwhich he had seen, he earnestly prayed God would make and keep clear his\\n\\npath before him. And then he fell asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had had a long dream of other and happier days, and had thought he\\n\\nwas once more taking a Sunday evening walk with his mother, when he was\\n\\nroughly wakened up by his cousins.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say, lad, you\\'re lying right across the bed. You must get up, and let\\n\\nDick and me come in, and then creep into the space that\\'s left.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom got up dizzy and half awake. His cousins got into bed, and then\\n\\nsquabbled about the largest share. It ended in a kicking match, during\\n\\nwhich Tom stood shivering by the bedside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure we\\'re pinched enough as it is,\" said Dick at last. \"And why\\n\\nthey\\'ve put Tom in with us I can\\'t think. But I\\'ll not stand it. Tom\\n\\nshan\\'t sleep with us. He may lie on the floor, if he likes. I\\'ll not\\n\\nhinder him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe expected an opposition from Tom, and was rather surprised when he\\n\\nheard the little fellow quietly lie down, and cover himself as well as\\n\\nhe could with his clothes. After some more quarrelling, Jack and Dick\\n\\nfell asleep. But in the middle of the night Dick awoke, and heard by\\n\\nTom\\'s breathing that he was still awake, and was crying gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What! molly-coddle, crying for a softer bed?\" asked Dick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no--I don\\'t care for that--if--oh! if mother were but alive,\"\\n\\nlittle Tom sobbed aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say,\" said Dick, after a pause. \"There\\'s room at my back, if you\\'ll\\n\\ncreep in. There! don\\'t be afraid--why, how cold you are, lad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDick was sorry for his cousin\\'s loss, but could not speak about it.\\n\\nHowever, his kind tone sank into Tom\\'s heart, and he fell asleep once\\n\\nmore.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three boys all got up at the same time in the morning, but were\\n\\nnot inclined to talk. Jack and Dick put on their clothes as fast as\\n\\npossible, and ran downstairs; but this was quite a different way of\\n\\ngoing on to what Tom had been accustomed. He looked about for some kind\\n\\nof basin or mug to wash in; there was none--not even a jug of water in\\n\\nthe room. He slipped on a few necessary clothes, and went downstairs,\\n\\nfound a pitcher, and went off to the pump. His cousins, who were playing\\n\\nin the court, laughed at him, and would not tell him where the soap was\\n\\nkept: he had to look some minutes before he could find it. Then he went\\n\\nback to the bedroom; but on entering it from the fresh air, the smell\\n\\nwas so oppressive that he could not endure it. Three people had been\\n\\nbreathing the air all night, and had used up every particle many times\\n\\nover and over again; and each time that it had been sent out from the\\n\\nlungs, it was less fit than before to be breathed again. They had not\\n\\nfelt how poisonous it was while they stayed in it; they had only felt\\n\\ntired and unrefreshed, with a dull headache; but now that Tom came back\\n\\nagain into it, he could not mistake its oppressive nature. He went to\\n\\nthe window to try and open it. It was what people call a \"Yorkshire\\n\\nlight,\" where you know one-half has to be pushed on one side. It was\\n\\nvery stiff, for it had not been opened for a long time. Tom pushed\\n\\nagainst it with all his might; at length it gave way with a jerk; and\\n\\nthe shake sent out a cracked pane, which fell on the floor in a hundred\\n\\nlittle bits. Tom was sadly frightened when he saw what he had done. He\\n\\nwould have been sorry to have done mischief at any time, but he had seen\\n\\nenough of his aunt the evening before to find out that she was sharp,\\n\\nand hasty, and cross; and it was hard to have to begin the first day in\\n\\nhis new home by getting into a scrape. He sat down on the bedside, and\\n\\nbegan to cry. But the morning air blowing in upon him, refreshed him,\\n\\nand made him feel stronger. He grew braver as he washed himself in the\\n\\npure, cold water. \"She can\\'t be cross with me longer than a day; by\\n\\nto-night it will be all over; I can bear it for a day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDick came running upstairs for something he had forgotten.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My word, Tom! but you\\'ll catch it!\" exclaimed he, when he saw the\\n\\nbroken window. He was half pleased at the event, and half sorry for Tom.\\n\\n\"Mother did so beat Jack last week for throwing a stone right through\\n\\nthe window downstairs. He kept out of the way till night, but she was on\\n\\nthe look-out for him, and as soon as she saw him, she caught hold of him\\n\\nand gave it him. Eh! Tom, I would not be you for a deal!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom began to cry again at this account of his aunt\\'s anger; Dick became\\n\\nmore and more sorry for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell thee what; we\\'ll go down and say it was a lad in yon\\n\\nback-yard throwing stones, and that one went smack through the window.\\n\\nI\\'ve got one in my pocket that will just do to show.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said Tom, suddenly stopping crying. \"I dare not do that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Daren\\'t! Why you\\'ll have to dare much more if you go down and face\\n\\nmother without some such story.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No! I shan\\'t. I shan\\'t have to dare God\\'s anger. Mother taught me to\\n\\nfear that; she said I need never be really afraid of aught else. Just be\\n\\nquiet, Dick, while I say my prayers.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDick watched his little cousin kneel down by the bed, and bury his face\\n\\nin the clothes; he did not say any set prayer (which Dick was accustomed\\n\\nto think was the only way of praying), but Tom seemed, by the low murmuring\\n\\nwhich Dick heard, to be talking to a dear friend; and though at first he\\n\\nsobbed and cried, as he asked for help and strength, yet when he got up,\\n\\nhis face looked calm and bright, and he spoke quietly as he said to\\n\\nDick, \"Now I\\'m ready to go and tell aunt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aunt\" meanwhile had missed her pitcher and her soap, and was in no\\n\\ngood-tempered mood when Tom came to make his confession. She had been\\n\\nhindered in her morning\\'s work by his taking her things away; and now he\\n\\nwas come to tell her of the pane being broken and that it must be\\n\\nmended, and money must go all for a child\\'s nonsense.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe gave him (as he had been led to expect) one or two very sharp blows.\\n\\nJack and Dick looked on with curiosity, to see how he would take it;\\n\\nJack, at any rate, expecting a hearty crying from \"softy\" (Jack himself\\n\\nhad cried loudly at his last beating), but Tom never shed a tear, though\\n\\nhis face did go very red, and his mouth did grow set with the pain. But\\n\\nwhat struck the boys more even than his being \"hard\" in bearing such\\n\\nblows, was his quietness afterwards. He did not grumble loudly, as Jack\\n\\nwould have done, nor did he turn sullen, as was Dick\\'s custom; but the\\n\\nminute afterwards he was ready to run an errand for his aunt; nor did he\\n\\nmake any mention of the hard blows, when his uncle came in to breakfast,\\n\\nas his aunt had rather expected he would. She was glad he did not, for\\n\\nshe knew her husband would have been displeased to know how early she\\n\\nhad begun to beat his orphan nephew. So she almost felt grateful to Tom\\n\\nfor his silence, and certainly began to be sorry she had struck him so\\n\\nhard.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor Tom! he did not know that his cousins were beginning to respect\\n\\nhim, nor that his aunt was learning to like him; and he felt very lonely\\n\\nand desolate that first morning. He had nothing to do. Jack went to work\\n\\nat the factory; and Dick went grumbling to school. Tom wondered if he\\n\\nwas to go to school again, but he did not like to ask. He sat on a\\n\\nlittle stool, as much out of his terrible aunt\\'s way as he could. She\\n\\nhad her youngest child, a little girl of about a year and a half old,\\n\\ncrawling about on the floor. Tom longed to play with her; but he was not\\n\\nsure how far his aunt would like it. But he kept smiling at her, and\\n\\ndoing every little thing he could to attract her attention and make her\\n\\ncome to him. At last she was coaxed to come upon his knee. His aunt saw\\n\\nit, and though she did not speak, she did not look displeased. He did\\n\\neverything he could think of to amuse little Annie; and her mother was\\n\\nvery glad to have her attended to. When Annie grew sleepy, she still\\n\\nkept fast hold of one of Tom\\'s fingers in her little, round, soft hand,\\n\\nand he began to know the happy feeling of loving somebody again. Only\\n\\nthe night before, when his cousins had made him get out of bed, he had\\n\\nwondered if he should live to be an old man, and never have anybody to\\n\\nlove all that long time; but now his heart felt quite warm to the little\\n\\nthing that lay on his lap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'ll tire you, Tom,\" said her mother, \"you\\'d better let me put her\\n\\ndown in the cot.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" said he, \"please don\\'t! I like so much to have her here.\" He\\n\\nnever moved, though she lay very heavy on his arm, for fear of wakening\\n\\nher.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she did rouse up, his aunt said, \"Thank you, Tom. I\\'ve got my work\\n\\ndone rarely with you for a nurse. Now take a run in the yard, and play\\n\\nyourself a bit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis aunt was learning something, and Tom was teaching, though they would\\n\\nboth have been very much surprised to hear it. Whenever, in a family,\\n\\nevery one is selfish, and (as it is called) \"stands up for his own\\n\\nrights,\" there are no feelings of gratitude; the gracefulness of \"thanks\"\\n\\nis never called for; nor can there be any occasion for thoughtfulness\\n\\nfor others when those others are sure to get the start in thinking for\\n\\nthemselves, and taking care of number one. Tom\\'s aunt had never had to\\n\\nremind Jack or Dick to go out to play. They were ready enough to see\\n\\nafter their own pleasures.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell! dinner-time came, and all the family gathered to the meal. It\\n\\nseemed to be a scramble who should be helped first, and cry out for the\\n\\nbest pieces. Tom looked very red. His aunt in her new-born liking for\\n\\nhim, helped him early to what she thought he would like. But he did not\\n\\nbegin to eat. It had been his mother\\'s custom to teach her little son\\n\\nto say a simple \"grace\" with her before they began their dinner. He\\n\\nexpected his uncle to follow the same observance; and waited. Then he\\n\\nfelt very hot and shy; but, thinking that it was right to say it, he\\n\\nput away his shyness, and very quietly, but very solemnly said the old\\n\\naccustomed sentence of thanksgiving. Jack burst out laughing when he had\\n\\ndone; for which Jack\\'s father gave him a sharp rap and a sharp word,\\n\\nwhich made him silent through the rest of the dinner. But, excepting\\n\\nJack, who was angry, I think all the family were the happier for having\\n\\nlistened reverently (if with some surprise) to Tom\\'s thanksgiving. They\\n\\nwere not an ill-disposed set of people, but wanted thoughtfulness in\\n\\ntheir every-day life; that sort of thoughtfulness which gives order to a\\n\\nhome, and makes a wise and holy spirit of love the groundwork of order.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom that first day Tom never went back in the regard he began then to\\n\\nwin. He was useful to his aunt, and patiently bore her hasty ways, until\\n\\nfor very shame she left off being hasty with one who was always so meek\\n\\nand mild. His uncle sometimes said he was more like a girl than a boy,\\n\\nas was to be looked for from being brought up for so many years by a\\n\\nwoman; but that was the greatest fault he ever had to find with him; and\\n\\nin spite of it, he really respected him for the very qualities which are\\n\\nmost truly \"manly;\" for the courage with which he dared to do what was\\n\\nright, and the quiet firmness with which he bore many kinds of pain. As\\n\\nfor little Annie, her friendship and favour and love were the delight of\\n\\nTom\\'s heart. He did not know how much the others were growing to like\\n\\nhim, but Annie showed it in every way, and he loved her in return most\\n\\ndearly. Dick soon found out how useful Tom could be to him in his\\n\\nlessons; for though older than his cousin, Master Dick was a regular\\n\\ndunce, and had never even wished to learn till Tom came; and long before\\n\\nJack could be brought to acknowledge it, Dick maintained that \"Tom had a\\n\\ngreat deal of pluck in him, though it was not of Jack\\'s kind.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I shall jump another year, and tell you a very little about the\\n\\nhousehold twelve months after Tom had entered it. I said above that his\\n\\naunt had learned to speak less crossly to one who was always gentle\\n\\nafter her scoldings. By-and-by her ways to all became less hasty and\\n\\npassionate, for she grew ashamed of speaking to any one in an angry way\\n\\nbefore Tom; he always looked so sad and sorry to hear her. She has also\\n\\nspoken to him sometimes about his mother; at first because she thought\\n\\nhe would like it; but latterly because she became really interested to\\n\\nhear of her ways; and Tom being an only child, and his mother\\'s friend\\n\\nand companion, has been able to tell her of many household arts of\\n\\ncomfort, which coming quite unconscious of any purpose, from the lips of\\n\\na child, have taught her many things which she would have been too proud\\n\\nto learn from an older person. Her husband is softened by the additional\\n\\ncleanliness and peace of his home. He does not now occasionally take\\n\\nrefuge in a public-house, to get out of the way of noisy children, an\\n\\nunswept hearth, and a scolding wife. Once when Tom was ill for a day or\\n\\ntwo, his uncle missed the accustomed grace, and began to say it himself.\\n\\nHe is now the person to say \"Silence, boys;\" and then to ask the blessing\\n\\non the meal. It makes them gather round the table, instead of sitting\\n\\ndown here and there in the comfortless, unsociable way they used to do.\\n\\nTom and Dick go to school together now, and Dick is getting on famously,\\n\\nand will soon be able to help his next brother over his lessons, as Tom\\n\\nhas helped him.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Jack has been heard to acknowledge that Tom has \"pluck\" in him; and\\n\\nas \"pluck\" in Jack\\'s mind is a short way of summing up all the virtues,\\n\\nhe has lately become very fond of his cousin. Tom does not think about\\n\\nhappiness, but is happy; and I think we may hope that he, and the\\n\\nhousehold among whom he is adopted, will go \"from strength to strength.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow do you not see how much happier this family are from the one\\n\\ncircumstance of a little child\\'s coming among them? Could money have\\n\\nmade one-tenth part of this real and increasing happiness? I think you\\n\\nwill all say no. And yet Tom was no powerful person; he was not clever;\\n\\nhe was very friendless at first; but he was loving and good; and on\\n\\nthose two qualities, which any of us may have if we try, the blessing of\\n\\nGod lies in rich abundance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBESSY\\'S TROUBLES AT HOME.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I\\'ve got you a Southport ticket,\" said Bessy Lee, as she\\n\\nburst into a room where a pale, sick woman lay dressed on the outside of\\n\\na bed. \"Aren\\'t you glad?\" asked she, as her mother moved uneasily, but\\n\\ndid not speak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, dear, I\\'m very thankful to you; but your sudden coming in has made\\n\\nmy heart flutter so, I\\'m ready to choke.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor Bessy\\'s eyes filled with tears: but, it must be owned, they were\\n\\ntears half of anger. She had taken such pains, ever since the doctor\\n\\nsaid that Southport was the only thing for her mother, to get her an\\n\\norder from some subscriber to the charity; and she had rushed to her, in\\n\\nthe full glow of success, and now her mother seemed more put out by the\\n\\nnoise she had made on coming in, than glad to receive the news she had\\n\\nbrought.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lee took her hand and tried to speak, but, as she said, she was\\n\\nalmost choked with the palpitation at her heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You think it very silly in me, dear, to be so easily startled; but it\\n\\nis not altogether silliness; it is I am so weak that every little noise\\n\\ngives me quite a fright. I shall be better, love, please God, when I\\n\\ncome back from Southport. I am so glad you\\'ve got the order, for you\\'ve\\n\\ntaken a deal of pains about it.\" Mrs. Lee sighed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want to go?\" asked Bessy, rather sadly. \"You always seem so\\n\\nsorrowful and anxious when we talk about it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s partly my being ailing that makes me anxious, I know,\" said Mrs.\\n\\nLee. \"But it seems as if so many things might happen while I was away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy felt a little impatient. Young people in strong health can hardly\\n\\nunderstand the fears that beset invalids. Bessy was a kind-hearted girl,\\n\\nbut rather headstrong, and just now a little disappointed. She forgot\\n\\nthat her mother had had to struggle hard with many cares ever since she\\n\\nhad been left a widow, and that her illness now had made her nervous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What nonsense, mother! What can happen? I can take care of the house\\n\\nand the little ones, and Tom and Jem can take care of themselves. What\\n\\nis to happen?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Jenny may fall into the fire,\" murmured Mrs. Lee, who found little\\n\\ncomfort in being talked to in this way. \"Or your father\\'s watch may be\\n\\nstolen while you are in, talking with the neighbours, or----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now come, mother, you know I\\'ve had the charge of Jenny ever since\\n\\nfather died, and you began to go out washing--and I\\'ll lock father\\'s\\n\\nwatch up in the box in our room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then Tom and Jem won\\'t know at what time to go to the factory. Besides,\\n\\nBessy,\" said she, raising herself up, \"they\\'re are but young lads, and\\n\\nthere\\'s a deal of temptation to take them away from their homes, if\\n\\ntheir homes are not comfortable and pleasant to them. It\\'s that, more\\n\\nthan anything, I\\'ve been fretting about all the time I\\'ve been\\n\\nill,--that I\\'ve lost the power of making this house the cleanest and\\n\\nbrightest place they know. But it\\'s no use fretting,\" said she, falling\\n\\nback weakly upon the bed and sighing. \"I must leave it in God\\'s hands.\\n\\nHe raiseth up and He bringeth low.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy stood silent for a minute or two. Then she said, \"Well, mother, I\\n\\nwill try to make home comfortable for the lads, if you\\'ll but keep your\\n\\nmind easy, and go off to Southport quiet and cheerful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" said Mrs. Lee, taking hold of Bessy\\'s hand, and looking up\\n\\nthankfully in her face.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next Wednesday she set off, leaving home with a heavy heart, which,\\n\\nhowever, she struggled against, and tried to make more faithful. But she\\n\\nwished her three weeks at Southport were over.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and Jem were both older than Bessy, and she was fifteen. Then came\\n\\nBill and Mary and little Jenny. They were all good children, and all had\\n\\nfaults. Tom and Jem helped to support the family by their earnings at\\n\\nthe factory, and gave up their wages very cheerfully for this purpose,\\n\\nto their mother, who, however, insisted on a little being put by every\\n\\nweek in the savings\\' bank. It was one of her griefs now that, when the\\n\\ndoctor ordered her some expensive delicacy in the way of diet during her\\n\\nillness (a thing which she persisted in thinking she could have done\\n\\nwithout), her boys had gone and taken their money out in order to\\n\\nprocure it for her. The article in question did not cost one quarter\\n\\nof the amount of their savings, but they had put off returning the\\n\\nremainder into the bank, saying the doctor\\'s bill had yet to be paid,\\n\\nand that it seemed so silly to be always taking money in and out. But\\n\\nmeanwhile Mrs. Lee feared lest it should be spent, and begged them to\\n\\nrestore it to the savings\\' bank. This had not been done when she left\\n\\nfor Southport. Bill and Mary went to school. Little Jenny was the\\n\\ndarling of all, and toddled about at home, having been her sister\\n\\nBessy\\'s especial charge when all went on well, and the mother used to\\n\\ngo out to wash.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lee, however, had always made a point of giving all her children\\n\\nwho were at home a comfortable breakfast at seven, before she set out\\n\\nto her day\\'s work; and she prepared the boys\\' dinner ready for Bessy\\n\\nto warm for them. At night, too, she was anxious to be at home as soon\\n\\nafter her boys as she could; and many of her employers respected her\\n\\nwish, and, finding her hard-working and conscientious, took care to set\\n\\nher at liberty early in the evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy felt very proud and womanly when she returned home from seeing\\n\\nher mother off by the railway. She looked round the house with a new\\n\\nfeeling of proprietorship, and then went to claim little Jenny from the\\n\\nneighbour\\'s where she had been left while Bessy had gone to the station.\\n\\nThey asked her to stay and have a bit of chat; but she replied that she\\n\\ncould not, for that it was near dinner-time, and she refused the\\n\\ninvitation that was then given her to go in some evening. She was full\\n\\nof good plans and resolutions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat afternoon she took Jenny and went to her teacher\\'s to borrow a\\n\\nbook, which she meant to ask one of her brothers to read to her in the\\n\\nevenings while she worked. She knew that it was a book which Jem would\\n\\nlike, for though she had never read it, one of her school-fellows had\\n\\ntold her it was all about the sea, and desert islands, and cocoanut-trees,\\n\\njust the things that Jem liked to hear about. How happy they would all\\n\\nbe this evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe hurried Jenny off to bed before her brothers came home; Jenny did\\n\\nnot like to go so early, and had to be bribed and coaxed to give up the\\n\\npleasure of sitting on brother Tom\\'s knee; and when she was in bed, she\\n\\ncould not go to sleep, and kept up a little whimper of distress. Bessy\\n\\nkept calling out to her, now in gentle, now in sharp tones, as she made\\n\\nthe hearth clean and bright against her brothers\\' return, as she settled\\n\\nBill and Mary to their next day\\'s lessons, and got her work ready for a\\n\\nhappy evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently the elder boys came in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Jenny?\" asked Tom, the first thing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve put her to bed,\" said Bessy. \"I\\'ve borrowed a book for you to read\\n\\nto me while I darn the stockings; and it was time for Jenny to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mother never puts her to bed so soon,\" said Tom, dissatisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But she\\'d be so in the way of any quietness over our reading,\" said\\n\\nBessy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to read,\" said Tom; \"I want Jenny to sit on my knee, as\\n\\nshe always does, while I eat my supper.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom, Tom, dear Tom!\" called out little Jenny, who had heard his voice,\\n\\nand, perhaps, a little of the conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom made but two steps upstairs, and re-appeared with Jenny in his arms,\\n\\nin her night-clothes. The little girl looked at Bessy half triumphant\\n\\nand half afraid. Bessy did not speak, but she was evidently very much\\n\\ndispleased. Tom began to eat his porridge with Jenny on his knee. Bessy\\n\\nsat in sullen silence; she was vexed with Tom, vexed with Jenny, and\\n\\nvexed with Jem, to gratify whose taste for reading travels she had\\n\\nespecially borrowed this book, which he seemed to care so little about.\\n\\nShe brooded over her fancied wrongs, ready to fall upon the first person\\n\\nwho might give the slightest occasion for anger. It happened to be poor\\n\\nlittle Jenny, who, by some awkward movement, knocked over the jug of\\n\\nmilk, and made a great splash on Bessy\\'s clean white floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind!\" said Tom, as Jenny began to cry. \"I like my porridge as\\n\\nwell without milk as with it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, never mind!\" said Bessy, her colour rising, and her breath growing\\n\\nshorter. \"Never mind dirtying anything, Jenny; it\\'s only giving trouble\\n\\nto Bessy! But I\\'ll make you mind,\" continued she, as she caught a glance\\n\\nof intelligence peep from Jem\\'s eyes to Tom; and she slapped Jenny\\'s\\n\\nhead. The moment she had done it she was sorry for it; she could have\\n\\nbeaten herself now with the greatest pleasure for having given way to\\n\\npassion; for she loved little Jenny dearly, and she saw that she really\\n\\nhad hurt her. But Jem, with his loud, deep, \"For shame, Bessy!\" and Tom,\\n\\nwith his excess of sympathy with his little sister\\'s wrongs, checked\\n\\nback any expression which Bessy might have uttered of sorrow and regret.\\n\\nShe sat there ten times more unhappy than she had been before the\\n\\naccident, hardening her heart to the reproaches of her conscience, yet\\n\\nfeeling most keenly that she had been acting wrongly. No one seemed to\\n\\nnotice her; this was the evening she had planned and arranged for so\\n\\nbusily; and the others, who never thought about it at all, were all\\n\\nquiet and happy, at least in outward appearance, while she was so\\n\\nwretched. By-and-by, she felt the touch of a little soft hand stealing\\n\\ninto her own. She looked to see who it was; it was Mary, who till now\\n\\nhad been busy learning her lessons, but uncomfortably conscious of the\\n\\ndiscordant spirit prevailing in the room; and who had at last ventured\\n\\nup to Bessy, as the one who looked the most unhappy, to express, in her\\n\\nown little gentle way, her sympathy in sorrow. Mary was not a quick\\n\\nchild; she was plain and awkward in her ways, and did not seem to have\\n\\nmany words in which to tell her feelings, but she was very tender and\\n\\nloving, and submitted meekly and humbly to the little slights and\\n\\nrebuffs she often met with for her stupidity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Bessy! good night!\" said she, kissing her sister; and, at the soft\\n\\nkiss, Bessy\\'s eyes filled with tears, and her heart began to melt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" continued Mary, going to the little spoilt, wilful girl, \"will\\n\\nyou come to bed with me, and I\\'ll tell you stories about school, and\\n\\nsing you my songs as I undress? Come, little one!\" said she, holding out\\n\\nher arms. Jenny was tempted by this speech, and went off to bed in a\\n\\nmore reasonable frame of mind than any one had dared to hope.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now all seemed clear and open for the reading, but each was too\\n\\nproud to propose it. Jem, indeed, seemed to have forgotten the book\\n\\naltogether, he was so busy whittling away at a piece of wood. At last\\n\\nTom, by a strong effort, said, \"Bessy, mayn\\'t we have the book now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No!\" said Jem, \"don\\'t begin reading, for I must go out and try and make\\n\\nNed Bates give me a piece of ash-wood--deal is just good for nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Bessy, \"I don\\'t want any one to read this book who does not\\n\\nlike it. But I know mother would be better pleased if you were stopping\\n\\nat home quiet, rather than rambling to Ned Bates\\'s at this time of\\n\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know what mother would like as well as you, and I\\'m not going to be\\n\\npreached to by a girl,\" said Jem, taking up his cap and going out. Tom\\n\\nyawned and went up to bed. Bessy sat brooding over the evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So much as I thought and I planned! I\\'m sure I tried to do what was\\n\\nright, and make the boys happy at home. And yet nothing has happened\\n\\nas I wanted it to do. Every one has been so cross and contrary. Tom\\n\\nwould take Jenny up when she ought to have been in bed. Jem did not\\n\\ncare a straw for this book that I borrowed on purpose for him, but sat\\n\\nlaughing. I saw, though he did not think I did, when all was going\\n\\nprovoking and vexatious. Mary--no! Mary was a help and a comfort, as she\\n\\nalways is, I think, though she is so stupid over her book. Mary always\\n\\ncontrives to get people right, and to have her own way somehow; and yet\\n\\nI\\'m sure she does not take half the trouble I do to please people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem came back soon, disappointed because Ned Bates was out, and could\\n\\nnot give him any ash-wood. Bessy said it served him right for going at\\n\\nthat time of night, and the brother and sister spoke angrily to each\\n\\nother all the way upstairs, and parted without even saying good-night.\\n\\nJenny was asleep when Bessy entered the bedroom which she shared with\\n\\nher sisters and her mother; but she saw Mary\\'s wakeful eyes looking at\\n\\nher as she came in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Mary,\" said she, \"I wish mother was back. The lads would mind her,\\n\\nand now I see they\\'ll just go and get into mischief to spite and plague\\n\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s for that,\" said Mary, softly. \"Jem did want that\\n\\nash-wood, I know, for he told me in the morning he didn\\'t think that\\n\\ndeal would do. He wants to make a wedge to keep the window from rattling\\n\\nso on windy nights; you know how that fidgets mother.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day, little Mary, on her way to school, went round by Ned\\n\\nBates\\'s to beg a piece of wood for her brother Jem; she brought it home\\n\\nto him at dinner-time, and asked him to be so good as to have everything\\n\\nready for a quiet whittling at night, while Tom or Bessy read aloud. She\\n\\ntold Jenny she would make haste with her lessons, so as to be ready to\\n\\ncome to bed early, and talk to her about school (a grand, wonderful\\n\\nplace, in Jenny\\'s eyes), and thus Mary quietly and gently prepared for a\\n\\nhappy evening, by attending to the kind of happiness for which every one\\n\\nwished.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Mary had thus been busy preparing for a happy evening, Bessy had\\n\\nbeen spending part of the afternoon at a Mrs. Foster\\'s, a neighbour of\\n\\nher mother\\'s, and a very tidy, industrious old widow. Mrs. Foster earned\\n\\npart of her livelihood by working for the shops where knitted work of\\n\\nall kinds is to be sold; and Bessy\\'s attention was caught, almost as\\n\\nsoon as she went in, by a very gay piece of wool-knitting, in a new\\n\\nstitch, that was to be used as a warm covering for the feet. After\\n\\nadmiring its pretty looks, Bessy thought how useful it might be to her\\n\\nmother; and when Mrs. Foster heard this, she offered to teach Bessy how\\n\\nto do it. But where were the wools to come from? Those which Mrs. Foster\\n\\nused were provided her by the shop; and she was a very poor woman--too\\n\\npoor to make presents, though rich enough (as we all are) to give help\\n\\nof many other kinds, and willing too to do what she could (which some of\\n\\nus are not).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two sat perplexed. \"How much did you say it would cost?\" said Bessy\\n\\nat last; as if the article was likely to have become cheaper, since she\\n\\nasked the question before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! it\\'s sure to be more than two shillings if it\\'s German wool. You\\n\\nmight get it for eighteenpence if you could be content with English.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I\\'ve not got eighteenpence,\" said Bessy, gloomily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I could lend it you,\" said Mrs. Foster, \"if I was sure of having it\\n\\nback before Monday. But it\\'s part of my rent-money. Could you make sure,\\n\\ndo you think?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Bessy, eagerly. \"At least I\\'d try. But perhaps I had\\n\\nbetter not take it, for after all I don\\'t know where I could get it.\\n\\nWhat Tom and Jem earn is little enough for the house, now that mother\\'s\\n\\nwashing is cut off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They are good, dutiful lads, to give it to their mother,\" said Mrs.\\n\\nFoster, sighing: for she thought of her own boys, that had left her in\\n\\nher old age to toil on, with faded eyesight and weakened strength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! but mother makes them each keep a shilling out of it for\\n\\nthemselves,\" said Bessy, in a complaining tone, for she wanted money,\\n\\nand was inclined to envy any one who possessed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right enough,\" said Mrs. Foster. \"They that earn it should have\\n\\nsome of the power over it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But about this wool; this eighteenpence! I wish I was a boy and could\\n\\nearn money. I wish mother would have let me go to work in the factory.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come now, Bessy, I can have none of that nonsense. Thy mother knows\\n\\nwhat\\'s best for thee; and I\\'m not going to hear thee complain of what\\n\\nshe has thought right. But may be, I can help you to a way of gaining\\n\\neighteenpence. Mrs. Scott at the worsted shop told me that she should\\n\\nwant some one to clean on Saturday; now you\\'re a good strong girl, and\\n\\ncan do a woman\\'s work if you\\'ve a mind. Shall I say you will go? and\\n\\nthen I don\\'t mind if I lend you my eighteenpence. You\\'ll pay me before I\\n\\nwant my rent on Monday.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! thank you, dear Mrs. Foster,\" said Bessy. \"I can scour as well as\\n\\nany woman, mother often says so; and I\\'ll do my best on Saturday; they\\n\\nshan\\'t blame you for having spoken up for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, Bessy, they won\\'t, I\\'m sure, if you do your best. You\\'re a good\\n\\nsharp girl for your years.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy lingered for some time, hoping that Mrs. Foster would remember her\\n\\noffer of lending her the money; but finding that she had quite forgotten\\n\\nit, she ventured to remind the kind old woman. That it was nothing but\\n\\nforgetfulness, was evident from the haste with which Mrs. Foster bustled\\n\\nup to her tea-pot and took from it the money required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re as welcome to it as can be, Bessy, as long as I\\'m sure of its\\n\\nbeing repaid by Monday. But you\\'re in a mighty hurry about this coverlet,\"\\n\\ncontinued she, as she saw Bessy put on her bonnet and prepare to go out.\\n\\n\"Stay, you must take patterns, and go to the right shop in St. Mary\\'s\\n\\nGate. Why, your mother won\\'t be back this three weeks, child.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. But I can\\'t abide waiting, and I want to set to it before it is\\n\\ndark; and you\\'ll teach me the stitch, won\\'t you, when I come back with\\n\\nthe wools? I won\\'t be half an hour away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Mary and Bill had to \"abide waiting\" that afternoon; for though the\\n\\nneighbour at whose house the key was left could let them into the house,\\n\\nthere was no supper ready for them on their return from school; even\\n\\nJenny was away spending the afternoon with a playfellow; the fire was\\n\\nnearly out, the milk had been left at a neighbour\\'s; altogether home was\\n\\nvery comfortless to the poor tired children, and Bill grumbled terribly;\\n\\nMary\\'s head ached, and the very tones of her brother\\'s voice, as he\\n\\ncomplained, gave her pain; and for a minute she felt inclined to sit\\n\\ndown and cry. But then she thought of many little sayings which she had\\n\\nheard from her teacher--such as \"Never complain of what you can cure,\"\\n\\n\"Bear and forbear,\" and several other short sentences of a similar\\n\\ndescription. So she began to make up the fire, and asked Bill to fetch\\n\\nsome chips; and when he gave her the gruff answer, that he did not see\\n\\nany use in making a fire when there was nothing to cook by it, she went\\n\\nherself and brought the wood without a word of complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Bill said, \"Here! you lend me those bellows; you\\'re not\\n\\nblowing it in the right way; girls never do!\" He found out that Mary was\\n\\nwise in making a bright fire ready; for before the blowing was ended,\\n\\nthe neighbour with whom the milk had been left brought it in, and little\\n\\nhandy Mary prepared the porridge as well as the mother herself could\\n\\nhave done. They had just ended when Bessy came in almost breathless; for\\n\\nshe had suddenly remembered, in the middle of her knitting-lesson, that\\n\\nBill and Mary must be at home from school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"that\\'s right. I have so hurried myself! I was afraid\\n\\nthe fire would be out. Where\\'s Jenny? You were to have called for her,\\n\\nyou know, as you came from school. Dear! how stupid you are, Mary. I am\\n\\nsure I told you over and over again. Now don\\'t cry, silly child. The\\n\\nbest thing you can do is to run off back again for her.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But my lessons, Bessy. They are so bad to learn. It\\'s tables day\\n\\nto-morrow,\" pleaded Mary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense; tables are as easy as can be. I can say up to sixteen times\\n\\nsixteen in no time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you know, Bessy, I\\'m very stupid, and my head aches so to-night!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! the air will do it good. Really, Mary, I would go myself, only\\n\\nI\\'m so busy; and you know Bill is too careless, mother says, to fetch\\n\\nJenny through the streets; and besides they would quarrel, and you can\\n\\nalways manage Jenny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMary sighed, and went away to bring her sister home. Bessy sat down to\\n\\nher knitting. Presently Bill came up to her with some question about his\\n\\nlesson. She told him the answer without looking at the book; it was all\\n\\nwrong, and made nonsense; but Bill did not care to understand what he\\n\\nlearnt, and went on saying, \"Twelve inches make one shilling,\" as\\n\\ncontentedly as if it were right.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary brought Jenny home quite safely. Indeed, Mary always did succeed in\\n\\neverything, except learning her lessons well; and sometimes, if the\\n\\nteacher could have known how many tasks fell upon the willing, gentle\\n\\ngirl at home, she would not have thought that poor Mary was slow or a\\n\\ndunce; and such thoughts would come into the teacher\\'s mind sometimes,\\n\\nalthough she fully appreciated Mary\\'s sweetness and humility of\\n\\ndisposition.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo-night she tried hard at her tables, and all to no use. Her head\\n\\nached so, she could not remember them, do what she would. She longed to\\n\\ngo to her mother, whose cool hands around her forehead always seemed to\\n\\ndo her so much good, and whose soft, loving words were such a help\\n\\nto her when she had to bear pain. She had arranged so many plans for\\n\\nto-night, and now all were deranged by Bessy\\'s new fancy for knitting.\\n\\nBut Mary did not see this in the plain, clear light in which I have put\\n\\nit before you. She only was sorry that she could not make haste with her\\n\\nlessons, as she had promised Jenny, who was now upbraiding her with the\\n\\nnon-fulfilment of her words. Jenny was still up when Tom and Jem came\\n\\nin. They spoke sharply to Bessy for not having their porridge ready; and\\n\\nwhile she was defending herself, Mary, even at the risk of imperfect\\n\\nlessons, began to prepare the supper for her brothers. She did it all\\n\\nso quietly, that, almost before they were aware, it was ready for them;\\n\\nand Bessy, suddenly ashamed of herself, and touched by Mary\\'s quiet\\n\\nhelpfulness, bent down and kissed her, as once more she settled to the\\n\\nnever-ending difficulty of her lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary threw her arms round Bessy\\'s neck, and began to cry, for this little\\n\\nmark of affection went to her heart; she had been so longing for a word\\n\\nor a sign of love in her suffering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come, Molly,\" said Jem, \"don\\'t cry like a baby;\" but he spoke very\\n\\nkindly. \"What\\'s the matter? the old headache come back? Never mind. Go\\n\\nto bed, and it will be better in the morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t go to bed. I don\\'t know my lesson!\" Mary looked happier,\\n\\nthough the tears were in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know mine,\" said Bill, triumphantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come here,\" said Jem. \"There! I\\'ve time enough to whittle away at this\\n\\nbefore mother comes back. Now let\\'s see this difficult lesson.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem\\'s help soon enabled Mary to conquer her lesson; but, meanwhile, Jenny\\n\\nand Bill had taken to quarrelling in spite of Bessy\\'s scolding,\\n\\nadministered in small sharp doses, as she looked up from her\\n\\nall-absorbing knitting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Tom, \"with this riot on one side, and this dull lesson on\\n\\nthe other, and Bessy as cross as can be in the midst, I can understand\\n\\nwhat makes a man go out to spend his evenings from home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy looked up, suddenly wakened up to a sense of the danger which her\\n\\nmother had dreaded.\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy thought it was very fortunate that it fell on a Saturday, of\\n\\nall days in the week, that Mrs. Scott wanted her; for Mary would be at\\n\\nhome, who could attend to the household wants of everybody; and so she\\n\\nsatisfied her conscience at leaving the post of duty that her mother had\\n\\nassigned to her, and that she had promised to fulfil. She was so eager\\n\\nabout her own plans that she did not consider this; she did not consider\\n\\nat all, or else I think she would have seen many things to which she\\n\\nseemed to be blind now. When were Mary\\'s lessons for Monday to be\\n\\nlearnt? Bessy knew as well as we do, that lesson-learning was hard work\\n\\nto Mary. If Mary worked as hard as she could after morning school she\\n\\ncould hardly get the house cleaned up bright and comfortable before\\n\\nher brothers came home from the factory, which \"loosed\" early on the\\n\\nSaturday afternoon; and if pails of water, chairs heaped up one on\\n\\nthe other, and tables put topsy-turvy on the dresser, were the most\\n\\nprominent objects in the house-place, there would be no temptation for\\n\\nthe lads to stay at home; besides which, Mary, tired and weary (however\\n\\ngentle she might be), would not be able to give the life to the evening\\n\\nthat Bessy, a clever, spirited girl, near their own age, could easily\\n\\ndo, if she chose to be interested and sympathising in what they had to\\n\\ntell. But Bessy did not think of all this. What she did think about was\\n\\nthe pleasant surprise she should give her mother by the warm and pretty\\n\\ncovering for her feet, which she hoped to present her with on her return\\n\\nhome. And if she had done the duties she was pledged to on her mother\\'s\\n\\ndeparture first, if they had been compatible with her plan of being a\\n\\nwhole day absent from home, in order to earn the money for the wools,\\n\\nthe project of the surprise would have been innocent and praiseworthy.\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy prepared everything for dinner before she left home that Saturday\\n\\nmorning. She made a potato-pie all ready for putting in the oven; she\\n\\nwas very particular in telling Mary what was to be cleaned, and how it\\n\\nwas all to be cleaned; and then she kissed the children, and ran off to\\n\\nMrs. Scott\\'s. Mary was rather afraid of the responsibility thrust upon\\n\\nher; but still she was pleased that Bessy could trust her to do so much.\\n\\nShe took Jenny to the ever-useful neighbour, as she and Bill went to\\n\\nschool; but she was rather frightened when Mrs. Jones began to grumble\\n\\nabout these frequent visits of the child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was ready enough to take care of the wench when thy mother was ill;\\n\\nthere was reason for that. And the child is a nice child enough, when\\n\\nshe is not cross; but still there are some folks, it seems, who, if you\\n\\ngive them an inch, will take an ell. Where\\'s Bessy, that she can\\'t mind\\n\\nher own sister?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gone out charing,\" said Mary, clasping the little hand in hers tighter,\\n\\nfor she was afraid of Mrs. Jones\\'s anger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I could go out charing every day in the week if I\\'d the face to trouble\\n\\nother folks with my children,\" said Mrs. Jones, in a surly tone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Shall I take her back, ma\\'am?\" said Mary, timidly, though she knew this\\n\\nwould involve her staying away from school, and being blamed by the dear\\n\\nteacher. But Mrs. Jones growled worse than she bit, this time at least.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said she, \"you may leave her with me. I suppose she\\'s had her\\n\\nbreakfast?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; and I\\'ll fetch her away as soon as ever I can after twelve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Mary had been one to consider the hardships of her little lot, she\\n\\nmight have felt this morning\\'s occurrence as one;--that she, who dreaded\\n\\ngiving trouble to anybody, and was painfully averse from asking any\\n\\nlittle favour for herself, should be the very one on whom it fell to\\n\\npresume upon another person\\'s kindness. But Mary never did think of any\\n\\nhardships; they seemed the natural events of life, and as if it was\\n\\nfitting and proper that she, who managed things badly, and was such a\\n\\ndunce, should be blamed. Still she was rather flurried by Mrs. Jones\\'s\\n\\nscolding; and almost wished that she had taken Jenny home again. Her\\n\\nlessons were not well said, owing to the distraction of her mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she went for Jenny she found that Mrs. Jones, repenting of her\\n\\nsharp words, had given the little girl bread and treacle, and made her\\n\\nvery comfortable; so much so that Jenny was not all at once ready to\\n\\nleave her little playmates, and when once she had set out on the road,\\n\\nshe was in no humour to make haste. Mary thought of the potato-pie and\\n\\nher brothers, and could almost have cried, as Jenny, heedless of her\\n\\nsister\\'s entreaties, would linger at the picture-shops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I shall be obliged to go and leave you, Jenny! I must get dinner\\n\\nready.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care,\" said Jenny. \"I don\\'t want any dinner, and I can come\\n\\nhome quite well by myself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMary half longed to give her a fright, it was so provoking. But she\\n\\nthought of her mother, who was so anxious always about Jenny, and she\\n\\ndid not do it. She kept patiently trying to attract her onwards, and\\n\\nat last they were at home. Mary stirred up the fire, which was to all\\n\\nappearance quite black; it blazed up, but the oven was cold. She put the\\n\\npie in, and blew the fire; but the paste was quite white and soft when\\n\\nher brothers came home, eager and hungry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! Mary, what a manager you are!\" said Tom. \"Any one else would have\\n\\nremembered and put the pie in in time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMary\\'s eyes filled full of tears; but she did not try to justify\\n\\nherself. She went on blowing, till Jem took the bellows, and kindly\\n\\ntold her to take off her bonnet, and lay the cloth. Jem was always kind.\\n\\nHe gave Tom the best baked side of the pie, and quietly took the side\\n\\nhimself where the paste was little better than dough, and the potatoes\\n\\nquite hard; and when he caught Mary\\'s little anxious face watching him,\\n\\nas he had to leave part of his dinner untasted, he said, \"Mary, I should\\n\\nlike this pie warmed up for supper; there is nothing so good as\\n\\npotato-pie made hot the second time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom went off saying, \"Mary, I would not have you for a wife on any\\n\\naccount. Why, my dinner would never be ready, and your sad face would\\n\\ntake away my appetite if it were.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Jem kissed her and said, \"Never mind, Mary! you and I will live\\n\\ntogether, old maid and old bachelor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo she could set to with spirit to her cleaning, thinking there never\\n\\nwas such a good brother as Jem; and as she dwelt upon his perfections,\\n\\nshe thought who it was who had given her such a good, kind brother, and\\n\\nfelt her heart full of gratitude to Him. She scoured and cleaned in\\n\\nright-down earnest. Jenny helped her for some time, delighted to be\\n\\nallowed to touch and lift things. But then she grew tired; and Bill was\\n\\nout of doors; so Mary had to do all by herself, and grew very nervous\\n\\nand frightened, lest all should not be finished and tidy against Tom\\n\\ncame home. And the more frightened she grew, the worse she got on. Her\\n\\nhands trembled, and things slipped out of them; and she shook so, she\\n\\ncould not lift heavy pieces of furniture quickly and sharply; and in\\n\\nthe middle the clock struck the hour for her brothers\\' return, when all\\n\\nought to have been tidy and ready for tea. She gave it up in despair,\\n\\nand began to cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Bessy, Bessy! why did you go away? I have tried hard, and I cannot\\n\\ndo it,\" said she aloud, as if Bessy could hear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Mary, don\\'t cry,\" said Jenny, suddenly coming away from her play.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help you. I am very strong. I can do anything. I can lift that pan\\n\\noff the fire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pan was full of boiling water, ready for Mary. Jenny took hold of\\n\\nthe handle, and dragged it along the bar over the fire. Mary sprung\\n\\nforwards in terror to stop the little girl. She never knew how it was,\\n\\nbut the next moment her arm and side were full of burning pain, which\\n\\nturned her sick and dizzy, and Jenny was crying passionately beside her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Mary! Mary! Mary! my hand is so scalded. What shall I do? I cannot\\n\\nbear it. It\\'s all about my feet on the ground.\" She kept shaking her\\n\\nhand to cool it by the action of the air. Mary thought that she herself\\n\\nwas dying, so acute and terrible was the pain; she could hardly keep\\n\\nfrom screaming out aloud; but she felt that if she once began she could\\n\\nnot stop herself, so she sat still, moaning, and the tears running down\\n\\nher face like rain. \"Go, Jenny,\" said she, \"and tell some one to come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, I can\\'t, my hand hurts so,\" said Jenny. But she flew wildly\\n\\nout of the house the next minute, crying out, \"Mary is dead. Come, come,\\n\\ncome!\" For Mary could bear it no longer; but had fainted away, and looked,\\n\\nindeed, like one that was dead. Neighbours flocked in; and one ran for\\n\\na doctor. In five minutes Tom and Jem came home. What a home it seems!\\n\\nPeople they hardly knew standing in the house-place, which looked as if\\n\\nit had never been cleaned--all was so wet, and in such disorder, and\\n\\ndirty with the trampling of many feet; Jenny still crying passionately,\\n\\nbut half comforted at being at present the only authority as to how the\\n\\naffair happened; and faint moans from the room upstairs, where some women\\n\\nwere cutting the clothes off poor Mary, preparatory for the doctor\\'s\\n\\ninspection. Jem said directly, \"Some one go straight to Mrs. Scott\\'s,\\n\\nand fetch our Bessy. Her place is here, with Mary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then he civilly, but quietly, dismissed all the unnecessary and\\n\\nuseless people, feeling sure that in case of any kind of illness, quiet\\n\\nwas the best thing. Then he went upstairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary\\'s face was scarlet now with violent pain; but she smiled a little\\n\\nthrough her tears at seeing Jem. As for him, he cried outright.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it was anybody\\'s fault, Jem,\" said she, softly. \"It was\\n\\nvery heavy to lift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you in great pain, dear?\" asked Jem, in a whisper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think I\\'m killed, Jem. I do think I am. And I did so want to see\\n\\nmother again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" said the woman who had been helping Mary. For, as she said\\n\\nafterwards, whether Mary died or lived, crying was a bad thing for her;\\n\\nand she saw the girl was ready to cry when she thought of her mother,\\n\\nthough she had borne up bravely all the time the clothes were cut off.\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy\\'s face, which had been red with hard running, faded to a dead\\n\\nwhite when she saw Mary; she looked so shocked and ill that Jem had not\\n\\nthe heart to blame her, although the minute before she came in, he had\\n\\nbeen feeling very angry with her. Bessy stood quite still at the foot of\\n\\nMary\\'s bed, never speaking a word, while the doctor examined her side\\n\\nand felt her pulse; only great round tears gathered in her eyes, and\\n\\nrolled down her cheeks, as she saw Mary quiver with pain. Jem followed\\n\\nthe doctor downstairs. Then Bessy went and knelt beside Mary, and wiped\\n\\naway the tears that were trickling down the little face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is it very bad, Mary?\" asked Bessy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh yes! yes! if I speak, I shall scream.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Bessy covered her head in the bed-clothes and cried outright.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was not cross, was I? I did not mean to be--but I hardly know what I\\n\\nam saying,\" moaned out little Mary. \"Please forgive me, Bessy, if I was\\n\\ncross.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"God forgive me!\" said Bessy, very low. They were the first words she\\n\\nhad spoken since she came home. But there could be no more talking\\n\\nbetween the sisters, for now the woman returned who had at first been\\n\\nassisting Mary. Presently Jem came to the door, and beckoned. Bessy rose\\n\\nup, and went with, him below. Jem looked very grave, yet not so sad as\\n\\nhe had done before the doctor came. \"He says she must go into the\\n\\ninfirmary. He will see about getting her in.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Jem! I did so want to nurse her myself!\" said Bessy, imploringly.\\n\\n\"It was all my own fault,\" (she choked with crying); \"and I thought I\\n\\nmight do that for her, to make up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Bessy,\"--before he had seen Bessy, he had thought he could\\n\\nnever call her \"dear\" again, but now he began--\"My dear Bessy, we both\\n\\nwant Mary to get better, don\\'t we? I am sure we do. And we want to take\\n\\nthe best way of making her so, whatever that is; well, then, I think we\\n\\nmust not be considering what we should like best just for ourselves, but\\n\\nwhat people, who know as well as doctors do, say is the right way. I\\n\\ncan\\'t remember all that he said; but I\\'m clear that he told me, all\\n\\nwounds on the skin required more and better air to heal in than Mary\\n\\ncould have here: and there the doctor will see her twice a day, if need\\n\\nbe.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBessy shook her head, but could not speak at first. At last she said,\\n\\n\"Jem, I did so want to do something for her. No one could nurse her as I\\n\\nshould.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem was silent. At last he took Bessy\\'s hand, for he wanted to say\\n\\nsomething to her that he was afraid might vex her, and yet that he\\n\\nthought he ought to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bessy!\" said he, \"when mother went away, you planned to do all things\\n\\nright at home, and to make us all happy. I know you did. Now may I tell\\n\\nyou how I think you went wrong? Don\\'t be angry, Bessy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think I shall never have spirit enough in me to be angry again,\" said\\n\\nBessy, humbly and sadly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So much the better, dear. But don\\'t over-fret about Mary. The doctor\\n\\nhas good hopes of her, if he can get her into the infirmary. Now, I\\'m\\n\\ngoing on to tell you how I think you got wrong after mother left. You\\n\\nsee, Bessy, you wanted to make us all happy your way--as you liked; just\\n\\nas you are wanting now to nurse Mary in your way, and as you like. Now,\\n\\nas far as I can make out, those folks who make home the happiest, are\\n\\npeople who try and find out how others think they could be happy, and\\n\\nthen, if it\\'s not wrong, help them on with their wishes as far as they\\n\\ncan. You know, you wanted us all to listen to your book; and very kind\\n\\nit was in you to think of it; only, you see, one wanted to whittle, and\\n\\nanother wanted to do this or that, and then you were vexed with us all.\\n\\nI don\\'t say but what I should have been if I had been in your place, and\\n\\nplanned such a deal for others; only lookers-on always see a deal; and I\\n\\nsaw that if you\\'d done what poor little Mary did next day, we should all\\n\\nhave been far happier. She thought how she could forward us in our\\n\\nplans, instead of trying to force a plan of her own on us. She got me my\\n\\nright sort of wood for whittling, and arranged all nicely to get the\\n\\nlittle ones off to bed, so as to get the house quiet, if you wanted some\\n\\nreading, as she thought you did. And that\\'s the way, I notice, some\\n\\nfolks have of making a happy home. Others may mean just as well, but\\n\\nthey don\\'t hit the thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I dare say it\\'s true,\" said Bessy. \"But sometimes you all hang about as\\n\\nif you did not know what to do. And I thought reading travels would just\\n\\nplease you all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem was touched by Bessy\\'s humble way of speaking, so different from her\\n\\nusual cheerful, self-confident manner. He answered, \"I know you did,\\n\\ndear. And many a time we should have been glad enough of it, when we had\\n\\nnothing to do, as you say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I had promised mother to try and make you all happy, and this is the\\n\\nend of it!\" said Bessy, beginning to cry afresh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But, Bessy! I think you were not thinking of your promise, when you\\n\\nfixed to go out and char.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought of earning money.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Earning money would not make us happy. We have enough, with care and\\n\\nmanagement. If you were to have made us happy, you should have been at\\n\\nhome, with a bright face, ready to welcome us; don\\'t you think so, dear\\n\\nBessy?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I did not want the money for home. I wanted to make mother a present of\\n\\nsuch a pretty thing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Poor mother! I am afraid we must send for her home now. And she has\\n\\nonly been three days at Southport!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Bessy, startled by this notion of Jem\\'s; \"don\\'t, don\\'t send\\n\\nfor mother. The doctor did say so much about her going to Southport\\n\\nbeing the only thing for her, and I did so try to get her an order! It\\n\\nwill kill her, Jem! indeed it will; you don\\'t know how weak and\\n\\nfrightened she is,--oh, Jem, Jem!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem felt the truth of what his sister was saying. At last, he resolved\\n\\nto leave the matter for the doctor to decide, as he had attended his\\n\\nmother, and now knew exactly how much danger there was about Mary. He\\n\\nproposed to Bessy that they should go and relieve the kind neighbour who\\n\\nhad charge of Mary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you won\\'t send for mother,\" pleaded Bessy; \"if it\\'s the best thing\\n\\nfor Mary, I\\'ll wash up her things to-night, all ready for her to go\\n\\ninto the infirmary. I won\\'t think of myself, Jem.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well! I must speak to the doctor,\" said Jem. \"I must not try and fix\\n\\nany way just because we wish it, but because it is right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAll night long, Bessy washed and ironed, and yet was always ready to\\n\\nattend to Mary when Jem called her. She took Jenny\\'s scalded hand in\\n\\ncharge as well, and bathed it with the lotion the doctor sent; and all\\n\\nwas done so meekly and patiently that even Tom was struck with it, and\\n\\nadmired the change. The doctor came very early. He had prepared\\n\\neverything for Mary\\'s admission into the infirmary. And Jem consulted\\n\\nhim about sending for his mother home. Bessy sat trembling, awaiting his\\n\\nanswer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am very unwilling to sanction any concealment. And yet, as you say,\\n\\nyour mother is in a very delicate state. It might do her serious harm\\n\\nif she had any shock. Well! suppose for this once, I take it on myself.\\n\\nIf Mary goes on as I hope, why--well! well! we\\'ll see. Mind that your\\n\\nmother is told all when she comes home. And if our poor Mary grows\\n\\nworse--but I\\'m not afraid of that, with infirmary care and nursing--but\\n\\nif she does, I\\'ll write to your mother myself, and arrange with a kind\\n\\nfriend I have at Southport all about sending her home. And now,\" said\\n\\nhe, turning suddenly to Bessy, \"tell me what you were doing from home\\n\\nwhen this happened. Did not your mother leave you in charge of all at\\n\\nhome?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Bessy, trembling. \"But, sir, I thought I could earn\\n\\nmoney to make mother a present!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thought! fiddle-de-dee. I\\'ll tell you what; never you neglect the work\\n\\nclearly laid out for you by either God or man, to go making work for\\n\\nyourself, according to your own fancies. God knows what you are most fit\\n\\nfor. Do that. And then wait; if you don\\'t see your next duty clearly.\\n\\nYou will not long be idle in this world, if you are ready for a summons.\\n\\nNow let me see that you send Mary all clean and tidy to the infirmary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJem was holding Bessy\\'s hand. \"She has washed everything and made it fit\\n\\nfor a queen. Our Bessy worked all night long, and was content to let me\\n\\nbe with Mary (where she wished sore to be), because I could lift her\\n\\nbetter, being the stronger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Even when you want to be of service to others, don\\'t\\n\\nthink how to please yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have not much more to tell you about Bessy. This sad accident of\\n\\nMary\\'s did her a great deal of good, although it cost her so much sorrow\\n\\nat first. It taught her several lessons, which it is good for every\\n\\nwoman to learn, whether she is called upon, as daughter, sister, wife,\\n\\nor mother, to contribute to the happiness of a home. And Mary herself\\n\\nwas hardly more thoughtful and careful to make others happy in their own\\n\\nway, provided that way was innocent, than was Bessy hereafter. It was a\\n\\nstruggle between her and Mary which could be the least selfish, and do\\n\\nthe duties nearest to them with the most faithfulness and zeal. The\\n\\nmother stayed at Southport her full time, and came home well and strong.\\n\\nThen Bessy put her arms round her mother\\'s neck, and told her all--and\\n\\nfar more severely against herself than either the doctor or Jem did,\\n\\nwhen they related the same story afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDISAPPEARANCES.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not in the habit of seeing the _Household Words_ regularly; but a\\n\\nfriend, who lately sent me some of the back numbers, recommended me to\\n\\nread \"all the papers relating to the Detective and Protective Police,\"\\n\\nwhich I accordingly did--not as the generality of readers have done, as\\n\\nthey appeared week by week, or with pauses between, but consecutively,\\n\\nas a popular history of the Metropolitan Police; and, as I suppose it\\n\\nmay also be considered, a history of the police force in every large\\n\\ntown in England. When I had ended these papers, I did not feel disposed\\n\\nto read any others at that time, but preferred falling into a train of\\n\\nreverie and recollection.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all I remembered, with a smile, the unexpected manner in which\\n\\na relation of mine was discovered by an acquaintance, who had mislaid or\\n\\nforgotten Mr. B.\\'s address. Now my dear cousin, Mr. B., charming as he\\n\\nis in many points, has the little peculiarity of liking to change his\\n\\nlodgings once every three months on an average, which occasions some\\n\\nbewilderment to his country friends, who have no sooner learnt the 19,\\n\\nBelle Vue Road, Hampstead, than they have to take pains to forget that\\n\\naddress, and to remember the 27, Upper Brown Street, Camberwell;\\n\\nand so on, till I would rather learn a page of _Walker\\'s Pronouncing\\n\\nDictionary_, than try to remember the variety of directions which I have\\n\\nhad to put on my letters to Mr. B. during the last three years. Last\\n\\nsummer it pleased him to remove to a beautiful village not ten miles out\\n\\nof London, where there is a railway station. Thither his friend sought\\n\\nhim. (I do not now speak of the following scent there had been through\\n\\nthree or four different lodgings, where Mr. B. had been residing, before\\n\\nhis country friend ascertained that he was now lodging at R----.) He\\n\\nspent the morning in making inquiries as to Mr. B.\\'s whereabouts in\\n\\nthe village; but many gentlemen were lodging there for the summer, and\\n\\nneither butcher nor baker could inform him where Mr. B. was staying; his\\n\\nletters were unknown at the post-office, which was accounted for by the\\n\\ncircumstance of their always being directed to his office in town. At\\n\\nlast the country friend sauntered back to the railway-office, and while\\n\\nhe waited for the train he made inquiry, as a last resource, of the\\n\\nbook-keeper at the station. \"No, sir, I cannot tell you where Mr. B.\\n\\nlodges--so many gentlemen go by the trains; but I have no doubt but\\n\\nthat the person standing by that pillar can inform you.\" The individual\\n\\nto whom he directed the inquirer\\'s attention had the appearance of a\\n\\ntradesman--respectable enough, yet with no pretensions to \"gentility,\"\\n\\nand had, apparently, no more urgent employment than lazily watching the\\n\\npassengers who came dropping in to the station. However, when he was\\n\\nspoken to, he answered civilly and promptly. \"Mr. B.? tall gentleman,\\n\\nwith light hair? Yes, sir, I know Mr. B. He lodges at No. 8, Morton\\n\\nVillas--has done these three weeks or more; but you\\'ll not find him\\n\\nthere, sir, now. He went to town by the eleven o\\'clock train, and does\\n\\nnot usually return until the half-past four train.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe country friend had no time to lose in returning to the village, to\\n\\nascertain the truth of this statement. He thanked his informant, and\\n\\nsaid he would call on Mr. B. at his office in town; but before he left\\n\\nR----station, he asked the book-keeper who the person was to whom he had\\n\\nreferred him for information as to his friend\\'s place of residence. \"One\\n\\nof the Detective Police, sir,\" was the answer. I need hardly say that\\n\\nMr. B., not without a little surprise, confirmed the accuracy of the\\n\\npoliceman\\'s report in every particular.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I heard this anecdote of my cousin and his friend, I thought that\\n\\nthere could be no more romances written on the same kind of plot as\\n\\nCaleb Williams; the principal interest of which, to the superficial\\n\\nreader, consists in the alternation of hope and fear, that the hero may,\\n\\nor may not, escape his pursuer. It is long since I have read the story,\\n\\nand I forget the name of the offended and injured gentleman, whose\\n\\nprivacy Caleb has invaded; but I know that his pursuit of Caleb--his\\n\\ndetection of the various hiding-places of the latter--his following up\\n\\nof slight clues--all, in fact, depended upon his own energy, sagacity,\\n\\nand perseverance. The interest was caused by the struggle of man against\\n\\nman; and the uncertainty as to which would ultimately be successful in\\n\\nhis object; the unrelenting pursuer, or the ingenious Caleb, who seeks\\n\\nby every device to conceal himself. Now, in 1851, the offended master\\n\\nwould set the Detective Police to work; there would be no doubt as to\\n\\ntheir success; the only question would be as to the time that would\\n\\nelapse before the hiding-place could be detected, and that could not be\\n\\na question long. It is no longer a struggle between man and man, but\\n\\nbetween a vast organized machinery, and a weak, solitary individual; we\\n\\nhave no hopes, no fears--only certainty. But if the materials of pursuit\\n\\nand evasion, as long as the chase is confined to England, are taken away\\n\\nfrom the store-house of the romancer, at any rate we can no more be\\n\\nhaunted by the idea of the possibility of mysterious disappearances; and\\n\\nany one who has associated much with those who were alive at the end of\\n\\nthe last century, can testify that there was some reason for such fears.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was a child, I was sometimes permitted to accompany a relation\\n\\nto drink tea with a very clever old lady, of one hundred and twenty--or,\\n\\nso I thought then; I now think she, perhaps, was only about seventy.\\n\\nShe was lively, and intelligent, and had seen and known much that was\\n\\nworth narrating. She was a cousin of the Sneyds, the family whence Mr.\\n\\nEdgeworth took two of his wives; had known Major Andr; had mixed in the\\n\\nOld Whig Society that the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire and \"Buff and\\n\\nBlue Mrs. Crewe\" gathered round them; her father had been one of the\\n\\nearly patrons of the lovely Miss Linley. I name these facts to show that\\n\\nshe was too intelligent and cultivated by association, as well as by\\n\\nnatural powers, to lend an over-easy credence to the marvellous; and\\n\\nyet I have heard her relate stories of disappearances which haunted\\n\\nmy imagination longer than any tale of wonder. One of her stories was\\n\\nthis:--Her father\\'s estate lay in Shropshire, and his park-gates opened\\n\\nright on to a scattered village of which he was landlord. The houses\\n\\nformed a straggling irregular street--here a garden, next a gable-end of\\n\\na farm, there a row of cottages, and so on. Now, at the end house or\\n\\ncottage lived a very respectable man and his wife. They were well known\\n\\nin the village, and were esteemed for the patient attention which they\\n\\npaid to the husband\\'s father, a paralytic old man. In winter, his chair\\n\\nwas near the fire; in summer, they carried him out into the open space\\n\\nin front of the house to bask in the sunshine, and to receive what\\n\\nplacid amusement he could from watching the little passings to and fro\\n\\nof the villagers. He could not move from his bed to his chair without\\n\\nhelp. One hot and sultry June day, all the village turned out to the\\n\\nhay-fields. Only the very old and the very young remained.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old father of whom I have spoken was carried out to bask in the\\n\\nsunshine that afternoon as usual, and his son and daughter-in-law went\\n\\nto the hay-making. But when they came home in the early evening, their\\n\\nparalysed father had disappeared--was gone! and from that day forwards,\\n\\nnothing more was ever heard of him. The old lady, who told this story,\\n\\nsaid with the quietness that always marked the simplicity of her\\n\\nnarration, that every inquiry which her father could make was made, and\\n\\nthat it could never be accounted for. No one had observed any stranger\\n\\nin the village; no small household robbery, to which the old man might\\n\\nhave been supposed an obstacle, had been committed in his son\\'s dwelling\\n\\nthat afternoon. The son and daughter-in-law (noted too for their\\n\\nattention to the helpless father) had been a-field among all the\\n\\nneighbours the whole of the time. In short, it never was accounted for;\\n\\nand left a painful impression on many minds.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will answer for it, the Detective Police would have ascertained every\\n\\nfact relating to it in a week.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis story from its mystery was painful, but had no consequences to make\\n\\nit tragical. The next which I shall tell (and although traditionary,\\n\\nthese anecdotes of disappearances which I relate in this paper are\\n\\ncorrectly repeated, and were believed by my informants to be strictly\\n\\ntrue), had consequences, and melancholy ones too. The scene of it is in\\n\\na little country-town, surrounded by the estates of several gentlemen of\\n\\nlarge property. About a hundred years ago there lived in this small town\\n\\nan attorney, with his mother and sister. He was agent for one of the\\n\\nsquires near, and received rents for him on stated days, which of course\\n\\nwere well known. He went at these times to a small public-house, perhaps\\n\\nfive miles from ----, where the tenants met him, paid their rents, and\\n\\nwere entertained at dinner afterwards. One night he did not return from\\n\\nthis festivity. He never returned. The gentleman whose agent he was,\\n\\nemployed the Dogberrys of the time to find him, and the missing cash;\\n\\nthe mother, whose support and comfort he was, sought him with all the\\n\\nperseverance of faithful love. But he never returned; and by-and-by the\\n\\nrumour spread that he must have gone abroad with the money; his mother\\n\\nheard the whispers all around her, and could not disprove it; and so her\\n\\nheart broke, and she died. Years after, I think as many as fifty, the\\n\\nwell-to-do butcher and grazier of ---- died; but, before his death, he\\n\\nconfessed that he had waylaid Mr. ---- on the heath close to the town,\\n\\nalmost within call of his own house, intending only to rob him, but\\n\\nmeeting with more resistance than he anticipated, had been provoked to\\n\\nstab him; and had buried him that very night deep under the loose sand\\n\\nof the heath. There his skeleton was found; but too late for his poor\\n\\nmother to know that his fame was cleared. His sister, too, was dead,\\n\\nunmarried, for no one liked the possibilities which might arise from\\n\\nbeing connected with the family. None cared if he was guilty or innocent\\n\\nnow.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf our Detective Police had only been in existence!\\n\\n\\n\\nThis last is hardly a story of unaccounted-for disappearance. It is only\\n\\nunaccounted for in one generation. But disappearances never to be\\n\\naccounted for on any supposition are not uncommon, among the traditions\\n\\nof the last century. I have heard (and I think I have read it in one of\\n\\nthe earlier numbers of _Chambers\\'s Journal_), of a marriage which took\\n\\nplace in Lincolnshire about the year 1750. It was not then _de rigueur_\\n\\nthat the happy couple should set out on a wedding journey; but instead,\\n\\nthey and their friends had a merry jovial dinner at the house of either\\n\\nbride or groom; and in this instance the whole party adjourned to the\\n\\nbridegroom\\'s residence, and dispersed, some to ramble in the garden,\\n\\nsome to rest in the house until the dinner-hour. The bridegroom, it is\\n\\nto be supposed, was with his bride, when he was suddenly summoned away\\n\\nby a domestic, who said that a stranger wished to speak to him; and\\n\\nhenceforward he was never seen more. The same tradition hangs about\\n\\nan old deserted Welsh Hall standing in a wood near Festiniog; there,\\n\\ntoo, the bridegroom was sent for to give audience to a stranger on his\\n\\nwedding-day, and disappeared from the face of the earth from that time;\\n\\nbut there, they tell in addition, that the bride lived long,--that she\\n\\npassed her three-score years and ten, but that daily during all those\\n\\nyears, while there was light of sun or moon to lighten the earth, she\\n\\nsat watching,--watching at one particular window which commanded a view\\n\\nof the approach to the house. Her whole faculties, her whole mental\\n\\npowers, became absorbed in that weary watching; long before she died,\\n\\nshe was childish, and only conscious of one wish--to sit in that long\\n\\nhigh window, and watch the road, along which he might come. She was as\\n\\nfaithful as Evangeline, if pensive and inglorious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat these two similar stories of disappearance on a wedding-day\\n\\n\"obtained,\" as the French say, shows us that anything which adds to\\n\\nour facility of communication, and organization of means, adds to our\\n\\nsecurity of life. Only let a bridegroom try to disappear from an untamed\\n\\n_Katherine_ of a bride, and he will soon be brought home, like a\\n\\nrecreant coward, overtaken by the electric telegraph, and clutched back\\n\\nto his fate by a detective policeman.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo more stories of disappearance, and I have done. I will give you the\\n\\nlast in date first, because it is the most melancholy; and we will wind\\n\\nup cheerfully (after a fashion). Some time between 1820 and 1830, there\\n\\nlived in North Shields a respectable old woman, and her son, who was\\n\\ntrying to struggle into sufficient knowledge of medicine, to go out as\\n\\nship-surgeon in a Baltic vessel, and perhaps in this manner to earn\\n\\nmoney enough to spend a session in Edinburgh. He was furthered in all\\n\\nhis plans by the late benevolent Dr. G----, of that town. I believe the\\n\\nusual premium was not required in his case; the young man did many\\n\\nuseful errands and offices which a finer young gentleman would have\\n\\nconsidered beneath him; and he resided with his mother in one of the\\n\\nalleys (or \"chares,\") which lead down from the main street of North\\n\\nShields to the river. Dr. G----had been with a patient all night, and\\n\\nleft her very early on a winter\\'s morning to return home to bed; but\\n\\nfirst he stepped down to his apprentice\\'s home, and bade him get up, and\\n\\nfollow him to his own house, where some medicine was to be mixed, and\\n\\nthen taken to the lady. Accordingly the poor lad came, prepared the\\n\\ndose, and set off with it some time between five and six on a winter\\'s\\n\\nmorning. He was never seen again. Dr. G---- waited, thinking he was at\\n\\nhis mother\\'s house; she waited, considering that he had gone to his\\n\\nday\\'s work. And meanwhile, as people remembered afterwards, the small\\n\\nvessel bound to Edinburgh sailed out of port. The mother expected\\n\\nhim back her whole life long; but some years afterwards occurred the\\n\\ndiscoveries of the Hare and Burke horrors, and people seemed to gain\\n\\na dark glimpse at his fate; but I never heard that it was fully\\n\\nascertained, or indeed more than surmised. I ought to add that all\\n\\nwho knew him spoke emphatically as to his steadiness of purpose, and\\n\\nconduct, so as to render it improbable in the highest degree that he\\n\\nhad run off to sea, or suddenly changed his plan of life in any way.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy last story is one of a disappearance which was accounted for after\\n\\nmany years. There is a considerable street in Manchester leading from\\n\\nthe centre of the town to some of the suburbs. This street is called at\\n\\none part Garratt, and afterwards, where it emerges into gentility and,\\n\\ncomparatively, country, Brook Street. It derives its former name from an\\n\\nold black-and-white hall of the time of Richard the Third, or thereabouts,\\n\\nto judge from the style of building; they have closed in what is left\\n\\nof the old hall now; but a few years since this old house was visible\\n\\nfrom the main road; it stood low on some vacant ground, and appeared to\\n\\nbe half in ruins. I believe it was occupied by several poor families who\\n\\nrented tenements in the tumble-down dwelling. But formerly it was Gerard\\n\\nHall, (what a difference between Gerard and Garratt!) and was surrounded\\n\\nby a park with a clear brook running through it, with pleasant fish-ponds,\\n\\n(the name of these was preserved until very lately, on a street near,)\\n\\norchards, dovecotes, and similar appurtenances to the manor-houses of\\n\\nformer days. I am almost sure that the family to whom it belonged were\\n\\nMosleys, probably a branch of the tree of the lord of the Manor of\\n\\nManchester. Any topographical work of the last century relating to their\\n\\ndistrict would give the name of the last proprietor of the old stock,\\n\\nand it is to him that my story refers.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany years ago there lived in Manchester two old maiden ladies, of high\\n\\nrespectability. All their lives had been spent in the town, and they\\n\\nwere fond of relating the changes which had taken place within their\\n\\nrecollection, which extended back to seventy or eighty years from the\\n\\npresent time. They knew much of its traditionary history from their\\n\\nfather, as well; who, with his father before him, had been respectable\\n\\nattorneys in Manchester, during the greater part of the last century:\\n\\nthey were, also, agents for several of the county families, who, driven\\n\\nfrom their old possessions by the enlargement of the town, found\\n\\nsome compensation in the increased value of any land which they might\\n\\nchoose to sell. Consequently the Messrs. S----, father and son, were\\n\\nconveyancers in good repute, and acquainted with several secret pieces\\n\\nof family history, one of which related to Garratt Hall.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe owner of this estate, some time in the first half of the last\\n\\ncentury, married young; he and his wife had several children, and lived\\n\\ntogether in a quiet state of happiness for many years. At last, business\\n\\nof some kind took the husband up to London; a week\\'s journey in those\\n\\ndays. He wrote and announced his arrival; I do not think he ever wrote\\n\\nagain. He seemed to be swallowed up in the abyss of the metropolis,\\n\\nfor no friend (and the lady had many and powerful friends) could ever\\n\\nascertain for her what had become of him; the prevalent idea was that\\n\\nhe had been attacked by some of the street-robbers who prowled about\\n\\nin those days, that he had resisted, and had been murdered. His wife\\n\\ngradually gave up all hopes of seeing him again, and devoted herself\\n\\nto the care of her children; and so they went on, tranquilly enough,\\n\\nuntil the heir came of age, when certain deeds were necessary before he\\n\\ncould legally take possession of the property. These deeds Mr. S----\\n\\n(the family lawyer) stated had been given up by him into the missing\\n\\ngentleman\\'s keeping just before the last mysterious journey to London,\\n\\nwith which I think they were in some way concerned. It was possible that\\n\\nthey were still in existence; some one in London might have them in\\n\\npossession, and be either conscious or unconscious of their importance.\\n\\nAt any rate, Mr. S----\\'s advice to his client was that he should put an\\n\\nadvertisement in the London papers, worded so skilfully that any one\\n\\nwho might hold the important documents should understand to what it\\n\\nreferred, and no one else. This was accordingly done; and although\\n\\nrepeated at intervals for some time, it met with no success. But at\\n\\nlast a mysterious answer was sent; to the effect that the deeds were in\\n\\nexistence, and should be given up; but only on certain conditions, and\\n\\nto the heir himself. The young man, in consequence, went up to London,\\n\\nand adjourned, according to directions, to an old house in Barbican,\\n\\nwhere he was told by a man, apparently awaiting him, that he must submit\\n\\nto be blindfolded, and must follow his guidance. He was taken through\\n\\nseveral long passages before he left the house; at the termination of\\n\\none of these he was put into a sedan-chair, and carried about for an\\n\\nhour or more; he always reported that there were many turnings, and that\\n\\nhe imagined he was set down finally not very far from his starting\\n\\npoint.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen his eyes were unbandaged, he was in a decent sitting-room, with\\n\\ntokens of family occupation lying about. A middle-aged gentleman\\n\\nentered, and told him that, until a certain time had elapsed (which\\n\\nshould be indicated to him in a particular way, but of which the length\\n\\nwas not then named), he must swear to secrecy as to the means by which\\n\\nhe obtained possession of the deeds. This oath was taken; and then the\\n\\ngentleman, not without some emotion, acknowledged himself to be the\\n\\nmissing father of the heir. It seems that he had fallen in love with a\\n\\ndamsel, a friend of the person with whom he lodged. To this young woman\\n\\nhe had represented himself as unmarried; she listened willingly to his\\n\\nwooing, and her father, who was a shopkeeper in the City, was not averse\\n\\nto the match, as the Lancashire squire had a goodly presence, and many\\n\\nsimilar qualities, which the shopkeeper thought might be acceptable to\\n\\nhis customers. The bargain was struck; the descendant of a knightly race\\n\\nmarried the only daughter of the City shopkeeper, and became a junior\\n\\npartner in the business. He told his son that he had never repented\\n\\nthe step he had taken; that his lowly-born wife was sweet, docile, and\\n\\naffectionate; that his family by her was large; and that he and they\\n\\nwere thriving and happy. He inquired after his first (or rather, I\\n\\nshould say, his true) wife with friendly affection; approved of what she\\n\\nhad done with regard to his estate, and the education of his children;\\n\\nbut said that he considered he was dead to her, as she was to him. When\\n\\nhe really died he promised that a particular message, the nature of\\n\\nwhich he specified, should be sent to his son at Garrett; until then\\n\\nthey would not hear more of each other; for it was of no use attempting\\n\\nto trace him under his incognito, even if the oath did not render such\\n\\nan attempt forbidden. I dare say the youth had no great desire to trace\\n\\nout the father, who had been one in name only. He returned to Lancashire;\\n\\ntook possession of the property at Manchester; and many years elapsed\\n\\nbefore he received the mysterious intimation of his father\\'s real death.\\n\\nAfter that, he named the particulars connected with the recovery of the\\n\\ntitle-deeds to Mr. S., and one or two intimate friends. When the family\\n\\nbecame extinct, or removed from Garratt, it became no longer any very\\n\\nclosely kept secret, and I was told the tale of the disappearance by\\n\\nMiss S., the aged daughter of the family agent.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more, let me say I am thankful I live in the days of the Detective\\n\\nPolice; if I am murdered, or commit bigamy, at any rate my friends will\\n\\nhave the comfort of knowing all about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nA correspondent has favoured us with the sequel of the disappearance\\n\\nof the pupil of Dr. G., who vanished from North Shields, in charge\\n\\nof certain potions he was entrusted with, very early one morning, to\\n\\nconvey to a patient:--\"Dr. G.\\'s son married my sister, and the young\\n\\nman who disappeared was a pupil in the house. When he went out with the\\n\\nmedicine, he was hardly dressed, having merely thrown on some clothes;\\n\\nand he went in slippers--which incidents induced the belief that he was\\n\\nmade away with. After some months his family put on mourning; and the\\n\\nG.\\'s (_very_ timid people) were so sure that he was murdered, that\\n\\nthey wrote verses to his memory, and became sadly worn by terror. But,\\n\\nafter a long time (I fancy, but am not sure, about a year and a half),\\n\\ncame a letter from the young man, who was doing well in America. His\\n\\nexplanation was, that a vessel was lying at the wharf about to sail in\\n\\nthe morning, and the youth, who had long meditated evasion, thought it a\\n\\ngood opportunity, and stepped on board, after leaving the medicine at\\n\\nthe proper door. I spent some weeks at Dr. G.\\'s after the occurrence;\\n\\nand very doleful we used to be about it. But the next time I went they\\n\\nwere, naturally, very angry with the inconsiderate young man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLondon: Printed by SMITH, ELDER & Co., 15, Old Bailey, E.C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\n\\n\\n1.
